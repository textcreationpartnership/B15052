            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

                     </gap>able, which support the huge weight of Kingdoms, as great <hi>Atlas</hi> the world, or the Gyants with their shoulders, <hi>viz. Iustice</hi> and <hi>Benevolence.</hi> The first being the excelling bright-shining mother of all lawes, and dominatrix over all publike Governments ot Reipub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licks, by which you judge your Citizens and Subjects, according to right and equity; unto which, both you and your subjects wils, power, counsell and desire, most willingly doe yeeld, submit, and are obedient unto; and which with the selfe same bands of Law, doth unite and annex together both you and your subjects alike. For this occasion, the ancient Philosophers in old time did feign,
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:177745:3"/> that justice continually did attend and wait upon their god <hi>Jupiter,</hi> and that <hi>Iupiter</hi> did receiue his instructions and precepts from Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice, to the end he might govern and rule all the kingdomes of the earth in good order, and that all his conclusions might be just and equall: Not that he did conclude and command after such a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner (as that wicked flatterer <hi>Anaxarchus</hi> did, who would make King <hi>Alexander</hi> beleeeue, that he had done very well in killing <hi>Cli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus,</hi> for whom <hi>Alexander</hi> made exceeding great lamentation:) but because Iustice which attended on him had concluded and comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded the same. For the wisest men in former times haue been of opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, that for the enjoying of justice, there must be good and gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle Kings set over the people.</p>
                  <p>Now although this vertue and knowledge doth so extend and spread it selfe abroad, through the understanding, manners, and liues of all men; that without the same, there can be no worthy act performed; neither can men liue honestly without the same: Yet is she of farre greater power (ô Princes) in this your great and illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strious office: for she requires, and will haue of you, that those Lawes which haue been given and left unto posterity, so many yeares agoe, by so many severall men your Predecessors, which you see and finde to be fitting and agreeable, to the understanding, condition, and manners of your people: that you (I say) doe hold and maintain the same, sacred, and unviolable: For if you abolish them, you abolish your Kingdomes, and precipitate them into a miserable destruction. For one and the same Law is not fitting for all people, like as the sword at <hi>Delphos</hi> was serviceable for many things: They neither will, nor can they all be ruled and governed with one and the same government. But your Predecessors, in their observation of the Lawes, which each of you enjoy, haue prescri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed unto you a lawfull, sure, and permanent government, which is the foundation and prop of your highest and godliest dignity.</p>
                  <p>Although you be not ignorant, what the other which I named <hi>Benevolence,</hi> is powerfull, and addeth to a fit and permanent go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, I mean that inclination, loue, will and affection, to doe good unto your subjects, and to provide for, and to augment them to the profit and commodity, as well of the generall, as of the particular; for whose commodity you acknowledge that all your
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:177745:3"/> counsels and actions must be measured and squared unto.</p>
                  <p>This <hi>Benevolence</hi> make<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>h you your subjects fathers, and not their Lords; their Pastors, and not their Butchers; their Kings, and not tyrants (nor cruel dominators). Out of this fountain doe you lead the currants of your other vertues, as mercy, lenity, familiarity, moderation, and liberality. Finally, this is the true desire and lust for the continuance of the common prosperity, for which cause Kingdoms are given and distributed unto you of the immortal God. Observing that subjects are not created and born for your sakes, to serue you: but you are ordained for the subjects sake, to the end that you should take care and provide for them, to be profitable unto them, to shelter and defend them, with your countenance, vertues and providence.</p>
                  <p>Vpon these two vertues subsisteth all the knowledge of govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; the greatnesse and power of all Princes, and the prosperity of all subjects: and that Prince which shall neglect and despise the same, possesseth a weak and impotent kingdom, and is indeed a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Tyrant, whose will and arrogancy is not to be obeyed.</p>
                  <p>Hereby you may easily understand, <hi>O most mighty and illustrious Princes of Christendome,</hi> in what manner we must esteem of <hi>Phillip</hi> king of <hi>Spaine.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And wheras the Lords, the States of the united <hi>Netherlands,</hi> doe oppose his violence and unjust government; I haue thought it good, to set down by way of discourse, and to touch a little the right or lawfulnesse of this warre, desiring that you, as good and righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous mediators, laying aside all secret hate, evill affection, and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiall partaking, will take notice and judge herof, with an upright, round, and pure conscience, out of that which I, in a true and short relation and historie (of those things which haue been perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med in the time of King <hi>Phillip,</hi> by his arrogancie, and licentious government) shall declare unto you.</p>
                  <p>When I intend to acquaint you herewith, the superfluity of mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter doth impoverish my counsell and skill, so that I cannot tell what speciall order and course I must use and obserue herein. I see that I must deale herein as Painters doe, who upon a little peece or tablet are to paint a great number of persons: for like as they doe demonstrate of some, but the face; of others, onely the top or
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:177745:4"/> crown of the head, all the other parts of their bodies being sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowed. In like manner will it be needfull that I, of so many things which haue been done in the <hi>Netherlands,</hi> undertake the relation of some few, and obserue the chiefe, eminent and principall poynts very roundly and briefly. From which you shall perceiue, that the beginning of our warre at the first, had great and just occasion, and that in the course and progression thereof, they are become greater and more just. But ô you <hi>Illustrious Princes</hi> at this present, be at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentiue to heare so great and weightie a businesse with wel-affected eares and minds, so many of you as there be, who for so many ages haue enjoyed your lawful and happy government, and seeke for the common good and prosperitie of your subjects. For I protest and sweare unto you, with pretious and holy words upon the altar of truth, that I wil not adde any thing hereunto, but that which is grounded and proceedeth from reason it selfe; neither in my rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion wil digresse or stray one fingers bredth from the truth.</p>
                  <p>That great Emperour <hi>Charles</hi> before he had pacified and quieted those great jar<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>es and troubles of the Empire, and had augmented the same with almost innumerable countries and kingdomes; hee performed almost endlesse and incredible journies and expeditions; nine in Germany, sixe in Spaine, seven in Italy, ten in the Nether<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lands, foure in peace and warre in France; Two expeditions he per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed in Africa, at what time he meant to leaue off and to end the warres in high Germany, the successe thereof seeming to be very un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certaine and doubtful: And being over-cloid with age and glory, leaving his government, departed into Spaine, and there in peace and quietnesse, yea in the greatest and happiest tranquilitie to finish and end his blessed age. Then did this most victorious Emperour disinherit and estrange himselfe from all his kingdomes, countries and provinces: And by this meanes, all the labours and cares of all the affaires of his father by inheritance descended unto his sonne <hi>Philip.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Vnto whom he often before (but more especially when (as I haue sayd) preparing him selfe the last time to goe for Spaine, and to leaue his life and the Netherlands) did exhort: (like as all good Princes doe that haue an especiall care for the will, vertue, care and affection of those that succeed them in their government,) and that
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:177745:4"/> very earnestly in the presence of the Prince of Orange, and the aged Bossu, and other Nobles: He did admonish him (I say) that he a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue all other his kingdomes and countries, should haue an especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all care and regard unto those Netherlandish Provinces; That hee should carefully remember, that these people were not used to bee governed with any hard or tyrannicall kinde of government, And that they had an abhomination &amp; a detestation of the severity, pride, and arrogancie of the Spaniards; And that they were exceedingly inclined to their owne lawes and liberties: unto which if his sonne <hi>Philip</hi> had not due regard, and thereunto endevoured himselfe, that he with all benevolence, and (as equitie requireth) with a just and righteous upholding of his lawes, did not maintaine this people; that the time would come, that his government in the Netherlands would be weakned.</p>
                  <p>This good Father and Patriot, and yet the most mightie Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour, was mindfull how often he had been faithfully assisted and holpen both with counsell and deeds in all his so many crosses and extremities, by his Netherlands: He knew well, when as he revol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving all the former times in his remembrance, that the government of all the Kings and Princes of Spaine were ever very severe, proud, and cruell; not onely against their subjects, but even against all other nations, and that there was already planted and setled in the Spani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards an naturall and old inveterate hate of the Netherlanders, which oftentimes very manifestly had appeared: He had also in especiall consideration, that his sonne <hi>Philip</hi> was borne and brought up in Spaine, and that he there with the milke of his Nourses had suckt in those great defects both of minde and manners, and that he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>senting thereunto, intended very advisedly to prosecute the same; and that he in all his manners and behaviours was like an absolute Spaniard; so that he could speak nothing but Spanish, and onely would bee served of none but Spaniards: And like as one peece of wood is bowed and made crooked by the art of man, and others grow even so: in like maner hath <hi>Philip</hi> both had and held from his birth and education, many defects which are not fitting for such Princes.</p>
                  <p>For as soone as the Emperour had left the Netherlands, even so soone left <hi>Philip</hi> the wholesome and provident counsels of his
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:177745:5"/> good father. And like as by the light of the Sunne, the light of a candle is obscured: And like as one drop of brine is annihilated by the widenesse of the great and spacious sea which devideth Asia from Christendome; even so were all those most excellent admoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the Emperour, (which like the voyce of a dying Swanne, a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

From whence you may understand (that which your selues, to your great losse and damage haue oftentimes proved to be true, since that time that <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lip</hi> came to the government of his kingdomes) that his proud arro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gancie and ambition is intollerable and incredible, that hee seek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth to purchase to himselfe over all men, (through his extreame greedinesse, and by meanes of all his treasures and oppression) an unlawfull power and meanes of government.</p>
                  <p>The warres in France which the Emperour by a truce had quie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, was by king <hi>Philip</hi> renewed: And whereas he for the mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance thereof, had desired a special taxation of the States of the Netherlands; the same was willingly, and with one consent of all the States granted: although that they before (as is aforesaid) had furnished the Emperour with many great summes of money in so many warres. For whereas according to the use and custome of their predecessors, all the States were assembled, and the voyce of every State required (for such matters might not be done without a general consent, the consent could not be without a preceding as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembly of the States) where was concluded to bring up a great summe of money for <hi>Philip</hi> for the terme of nine yeares, the which was called <hi>Subsidium novennale,</hi> or a nine yeares Subsidie; which was very serviceable for that warre: But much more, the farre fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous, and many yeares valour of the Netherlandish Champions, wherein they as wel also in many other warres, as in this, had effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted so much, that <hi>Phillip</hi> in two prosperous battails, having over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come and driven out of the field, the most mightie King of France,
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:177745:5"/> who afterward desiring peace, did prescribe unto him such lawes and conditions, which tended to his singular honor and profit. And certainly all men, but especially the conquered French, and ill-repining Spaniard, attributed the honor of this victory unto the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour and valiantnesse o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>And this one onely matter then was of such importance, that if King <hi>Philip</hi> by so many benefites done to his father, and unto him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe, could not be induced to <hi>Benevolence</hi> (yet aboue all, that most excellent testimony of the Queen of Hungary, being added thereun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to; who leaving the government of the Netherlands, d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

To whom both the Emperour and the King were especially beholden) yet notwithstanding by this alike-minded and uniforme consent, by this their fidelitie, by this their valour, and that of the chiefest of them, he ought to haue been kin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dled and inflamed to their loue, and to <hi>Benevolence.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But <hi>Philip</hi> rejected and cast at his heeles all these testimonies, and despised the benefites and valiant deeds of the Netherlanders. What doe I say despised? He hath recompensed them with most extreame hate, and most cruel and tyrannical deeds. For when the peace was concluded in France, it seemed hee tooke in very ill part, that the States a little before, in the conclusion of the 9 yeares subsidie, did not presently, when he had but scarce opened his mouth; and as soon as it did but please him, did not presently open unto him their whole treasurie, and cast downe before him at one instant, all their Treasurie; that they were not presently obedient unto his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand; But that first, they, according to their custome and law, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving held as it were a Parliament or convocation of the States be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing gathered together, and having taken counsel thereupon, to the end that the businesse might be granted by a general consent; and that there might be ordained what manner of persons should chiefly be appointed, into whose hands that mony might be delivered, and how the same might be distributed most conveniently for the kings <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

For these occasions did he (who oppresseth our libertie, and abbrogating the lawes of our Fathers, seeking to himselfe the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment alone, which indeed is mere tyranny, or cruel govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment) adjudge the bringing up of that money not as a <hi>Benefite,</hi> but

                     </gap>ing a jealous eye toward the States, as being enemies and refractory unto his government and dominion. For this was for <hi>Philip,</hi> and for all Spaniards, a suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent and lawful occasion enough to beginne to declare themselues enemie unto the Netherlanders; and violently to suppresse both their lawes, libertie and privileges.</p>
                  <p>This we know is the custome of all tyrants, that seek and hunt af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the very least occasions, masking the same with certain shewes of right, for the annihilating of the lawes of the subjects, and the pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of them down under foot.</p>
                  <p>After such a manner in former time did the sonne of <hi>Sixtus Tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quinus,</hi> who having the chiefe government of the citie of the Gabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, by treachery and false accusations, slew and banished all the Councel, to the end that he by that meanes might bring the citie un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the tyranny of his father. We also finde written of <hi>Iulius Caesar,</hi> that he intruding himselfe (against the lawes and priviledges) into a perpetual government; that all those who opposed his doings, that he with some kind of shew or appearance of truth, or else by some concealed treacherie, made them away.</p>
                  <p>The Spaniards themselues, haue even out of this haven of just complaints, and righteous accusations, put out to sea with full sails, intending long agoe, their cruel, sole, and chiefe government over the Netherlanders. And surely there wanted no inhabitants, who with their oares of most pestilent counsell, did row this ship to the Spanish tyranny. For there was one or two of the Nobilitie unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy their generation, and unworthy of their countrey; who being not able to make satisfaction for their dealings, and thought they could not stand fast and permanent, unlesse they overthrew the state of the common government, Among whom that great usurer <hi>Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemont</hi> extold and set up himselfe, and vomited out of his deadly mouth, all manner of wicked and poysoned counsel into the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some of the king: whereby the devotions of the Spaniards were provoked and stirred up to a greater violence, deceit, and to all evil proceedings. For the matter it selfe was come to that effect, that the king intended to haue executed the Earle of Lalaine, and all the States, being very wise and provident men, and certaine others who were Patriots of our Reipublick and State. These men (I say) who
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:177745:6"/> a little before had heaped so many benefits upon the King, and had set their liues in the ballance, and hazarded their estate for his good and government. What cruelty was ever greater then this? what sin or offence of ingratitude was ever greater then this which hath been spoken of? But yet moreover and aboue, ô Princes, heare what licentiousnesse and selfe-wil <hi>Philip,</hi> before his intended jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney into Spaine, had resolved by himselfe. Hee desired that they should take in Souldiers into all their chiefe cities, and out of their owne meanes to pay them monthly: And that all the Burgesses and subjects should bring up their Armes. They denied not the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of their supreme Lord, but desired that those souldiers which should be levied, might be of the inhabitants, and no Spaniards. The king persisted, that by all meanes they must be Spaniards, which should be raised, as upon whom he established the foundation of his cruel government. He commanded them that they should keepe good watch and ward in all the chiefe Castles and fortifications of the Provinces; who not restraining the hellish outrages of their en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitie and inveterate malice in the injuring and murthering of the Netherlanders; but presently gaue the reines thereto at Antwerpe, Atrecht, and Camerick all chiefe cities of the Netherlands.</p>
                  <p>Moreover, that which was altogether opposite to our lawes, and was very convenient for the effecting of his oppression, and for the establishing of his licentious government, <hi>Philip</hi> ordained and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyned certaine Spanish Counsellors to the States, having made choyce of such who naturally were proue and inclined for treche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, deceits, tyranny, or cruel government, as were the Earls of <hi>Feres, Ʋerges,</hi> and <hi>Eras,</hi> who in their bosomes should haue all the wil, go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment and counsel of king <hi>Philip,</hi> vnto whom he commanded that the States should giue place, and that they should, not doe any thing whatsoever, but what these great <hi>Catoes</hi> did approue.</p>
                  <p>Now when as the chiefe way of all the lands affaires was in their power, then must our people (the prudent wise-men and lovers of their countrey, and those that sought the welfare of the land) go up and downe like shadowes and were but a cypher among the figures, and were held for statues of stone, who participated of the govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, nothing but the bare name, and neither could nor might effect any thing that tended to the common good.</p>
                  <pb n="10" facs="tcp:177745:7"/>
                  <p>Then began our libertie and liues to be very uncertaine, and to be set to sale, for this is the very truth, ô Princes; king <hi>Philip</hi> and the Spaniards whose service he most used for his lascivious goverment, laboured all of them thereunto, like as in former times the anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Romanes did with their <hi>Decem-viri,</hi> or ten men, who required of the Grecians the observing of the new law of the twelue Tables (as they called it:) That we even so, rejecting and desp<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

They intended wholy to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verthrow and overwhelme our wel-setled Reipublick, to the end, that their owne pleasures, licentiousnesse, and arrogancie might be used in stead of our lawes. This was that which they called <hi>perfect and absolute obedience:</hi> but we may better call it <hi>Tyrannie:</hi> that is, a violent doing government, which resisteth and opposeth our good lawes and customes; with the which many yeares agoe they haue overwhelmd and distressed them of <hi>India, Sicilia, Calabria, Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laen, Arragon, and Portugall.</hi> The Spaniard suffereth none of these countries to liue after the pecul<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>Wherefore may they doe thus? Because the worthinesse and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty of the Spanish Monarchy (as they imagine) <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>equireth the same.</p>
                  <p>That great and ponderous <hi>Axioma</hi> and discipline of the Stoicks, doth prescribe unto them the same: for which they haue not gone to schoole to learne, nor haue studied for; but of their owne nature and understanding facultie, they seeme to haue swallowed up, and now of late to haue renewed the same, viz. In regard they doe hold and report that all nations of the earth, to be in respect of them, but their servants and bondslaues, yea for dumbe, foolish, dishono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable,
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:177745:7"/> miserable, and for very beasts: and contrarily doe esteem themselues for Kings, onely-wise, onely-rich, onely-happy, and onely-men. Among whom <hi>Phillip,</hi> as the onely <hi>Chrysippus,</hi> seemeth to under-prop and susteyn the gallerie or walking place of these supercilious Philosophers. And to proue this, they affirme, that it is lawfull for them, by the law of Armes to domineer over strange nations, considering that it is allowed for currant, by the Law of Nations, and Custome; that Conquerours must giue the Law to the conquered, according to their own pleasure.</p>
                  <p>If that we must (ô Princes) like as indeed we must, allow of this, as being an ancient Custome of all Nations; wherfore then doe the <hi>Spaniards</hi> attribute this lawfulnesse unto themselues here in the <hi>Netherlands,</hi> in regard the land descended to <hi>Phillip</hi> by inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, and not by force of Armes, nor violence, nor by any Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ni<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>These are the chiefe Lawes (although there be yet others much like unto these) by which even to this present, the liberty of the <hi>Netherlands,</hi> very long, and very exceeding well, and most flou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rishingly haue been maintained.</p>
                  <p>Behold and consider now ô Princes, I pray you, what I haue said and shall say of that violent, and most wrongfull Government of <hi>Phillip,</hi> how directly he hath opposed our liberty; yea, and Iustice it selfe.</p>
                  <pb n="15" facs="tcp:177745:9"/>
                  <p>It is not very needfull that I by many demonstrations proue that which already I haue proved; that <hi>Phillip</hi> hath violated the Lawes of the <hi>Netherlands,</hi> and that by meer force he seeketh to overwhelm and to turn the whole <hi>Netherlands</hi> topsie-turvie: considering that every man may see and reade out of the intercepted letters of <hi>Ala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na,</hi> the Embassadour of <hi>Phillip;</hi> That this is known for sure and certain; who in his letters written out of France unto the Princesse of <hi>Parma,</hi> then Governesse of the <hi>Netherlands,</hi> affirmeth: That it was certainly concluded by his King, to abrogate and quite abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish all the Priviledges of the <hi>Netherlanders;</hi> and that he would pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribe such a Law unto them, that no other Law should be of any force, then that which should be given them by his command, and with his counsel. And therfore he called for the Popes Authority to assist him; who acquitting and discharging him of his faith-keeping, of his sworn promises, and of his so high and sacred an oath, which he had sworn to maintain the Netherlandish Lawes, to the end he might afterwards (with the wind of this vain dispen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sation) with ful set sailes, brauely rush himselfe into the sea of the Spanish tyrannie; and that under pretext of the Romish Religion and Holinesse, such like cruelties and tyrannie which he useth to al good Princes and Nations of the earth, might under the same be sheltred and defended.</p>
                  <p>O injustice not to be concealed, ô too too unprovident and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy Prince to govern: For what could he haue done more rash<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, or more unprovident in his government, then to get himselfe freed from the oath which he had sworn to his subjects? So igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant in the land affaires was <hi>Phillip,</hi> that he understood not what a fast and firm obligation, and band of the conscience, wils, and all other affaires, is effected betwixt him and his subjects, by that mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall and reciprocal fidelity, and the respect to oathes: That he un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood not of what force the bonds of the Law and fidelity is, which annex and binde together the offices of all Princes, of Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seliours and of Subjects, of Lords and Vassals: For, for the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry selfe-same occasion that the Farmer or Tenant looseth the right of his Farme; the owner also by the same right is deprived of the proprietie of the same: The Tenant or Farmer is not bound to keep faith and promise with the owner, nor to be obedient unto him;
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:177745:10"/> if he deny to keep faith and promise with him, and to keep the rights of the Farm from him also.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Domitius</hi> the Oratour in times past said, wherfore should I ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledg you for a Prince, since you doe not acknowledge mee for a Counsellour; To which end <hi>Lucius Crassus</hi> said very well: Shall I acknowledge you for a Burgermaster, when you doe not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge me for a Counsellour? Wherfore then should not wee with one uniform voyce, say we acknowledge <hi>Philllip</hi> for no King who doth not acknowledge us for his Burgers? but holds us for particular and common enemies.</p>
                  <p>Therfore this persiduousnesse was hurtfull for <hi>Phillip</hi> when hee endevoured to discharge the States of the promise and Oath which they had made to him: So that they no more now need to esteem, nor be obedient unto him, as their Lord or Prince, but may by all right reject and defie him as a Tyrant, and as a common enemy to the Countrey. For as some men by sicknes, or by defect of the senses, doe not taste the daintinesse of the meat; even so now, such a mischievous lust and desire to effect all things what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever his heart imagineth, hath captivated <hi>Phillip,</hi> &amp; other Tyrants, that they can neither see nor perceiue what is profitable or hurtfull for themselues, in this their mischievous desire of unjust Soveraignty; but are by the cruelty of their natures transported and driven to all kinde of mischiefes and crimes worrhy of punishment.</p>
                  <p>But with what conscience, with what will, with what affection, ô <hi>Phillip,</hi> hast thou got such an abominable detestation of our Lawes, and dost so farre digresse from them, that for them thou shouldst so shamefully violate, break and make shipwrack of thy faith and truth, which all good Princes are accustomed to keep holy and unviola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, even as the ground-work and foundation of all justice? Were they unjust? Were they not conform to equity? Or did they any wise injurie thy dignity and Spanish Majestie? The Emperours, Kings and Princes thy Predecessours (who undoubtedly are to be prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red and accounted before thee in the worthinesse of their govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in lustre, glory and excellencie) they haue made and prescri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed them themselues, and in such manner so prescribed them, that they were sitting, just, and beseeming for a good Prince; by which the common welfare of the Netherlands might be supported and
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:177745:10"/> established, &amp; the prosperity &amp; perpetuity of our Reipublick, might remain setled and grounded in good order: For the making of them, hath that great &amp; mighty Emperor thy father, &amp; all thy Predecessors more applyed all their endevours, diligence, care, ability and vigi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancie, then thou ô <hi>Phillip,</hi> hast done for the overthrowing of them, and for the destruction of the whole Reipublick with thy tyrannie and violent oppression. For those good Princes understood very well (that which thou and all other Tyrants are used to deny and resist) that the onely office of good Princes is, to be alwaies mindfull, not onely of what is committed to their charge, but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so in what manner the same is committed to their charge: They were alwaies mindfull that they represented the body of the Common-wealth, and that they ought to maintain the dignity and the prospe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie of the same; to maintain the Lawes in their vigour, and to defend their Rights and Customes; and to haue in minde that super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>excellent and most royal speech of King <hi>Theohadades, When all things are in our power, then we simply beleeue that all commendable things are lawfull.</hi> Therfore <hi>Antigonus,</hi> the third King of the <hi>Mace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domans</hi> wrote unto his Cities, that if peradventure he had comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded or published any thing by letter or decree, that seemed to op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose their Lawes, that therin they should not be obedient; but should perswade themselues, that he either by ignorance, or by er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour was mistaken. Surely, this was a great and most excellent King, this King by chance, hearing one say, <hi>That all things without any dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference were lawfull and beseeming Kings,</hi> He therunto, both as well honourably, as providently, made reply: <hi>Yes, for the Barbarian Kings, but unto us, lawfull things are onely lawfull, and just things are onely just.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In like manner <hi>Themistocles,</hi> being required of <hi>Symonides,</hi> that for his advantage in the Court he would pronounce an unjust sentence, who answered: <hi>As thou couldst not be a good Poet, if thou shouldst transgresse measure in Poetry: So should not I be a good Prince, if I should conclude any thing contrary to the Lawes.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Dost not thou now see thy selfe, ô <hi>Phillip,</hi> in such like Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and in all the things which thou hast done, convinced of the Heathens and worldly Kings: wheras thou wilt be esteemed for a King; yea, and the Catholike King? Dost not thou see plainly that
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:177745:11"/> thou art convinced by their Testimonie, who were onely lead by na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to maintain Iustice and Equitie? Dost not thou see evidently by the testimony of every one, that thou art enforced to acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge that thou hast endevoured and stil endevourest thy selfe to Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rannie? And to the end that I may now passe unto other matters, yet I must not forget this proofe of his Tyrannie: that <hi>Phillip,</hi> from the time that he first took upon him the government of the Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therlands, would haue had, that the Convocation and the Assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly of the States should haue been holden in strange Countries; and that he many times, forbad, dispersed and hindred the meetings of the Lords of the Councel; when they according to their manner and custome in their Assemblies of State, did treat and deal in the behalfe of the common good of the Lands. For this Councel of the States was ordained, as a Protector of the Lawes, a Preserver, a Surveyer, and Defender of the Reipublick, and of all common affaires, and was the haven and refuge of the oppressed.</p>
                  <p>He to whom the charge was committed to see that the Reipub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick should not be endamaged; even him hath <hi>Phillip</hi> not permitted to come into the Assembly of the States. He concluded that he must haue another Councel; that he with that Councel could not effect his own counsel and tyrannie. For he had learned that of <hi>Tarquinus Superbus,</hi> who in the Roman government (which was left unto him of his Predecessors) used to dispose and order all things with counsel and advise, he took that clean away; and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ministred and served the Comonaltie with the counsel of his own opinion: And after him <hi>Iulius Caesar,</hi> who oppressed the Reipub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licks, made himselfe perpetual Dictator or President, and prohibited the Assemblies. The which Reipublicks afterward by <hi>Augustus</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing pacified and quieted were reduced into their former integrity. Which Assemblies <hi>Nero,</hi> that infamous Tyrant, in the beginning of his raign, did again prohibit. For <hi>Phillip</hi> not onely hated, troubled and separated, the Assemblies and Convocations of the States, but also of the Nobles and Burgesses, their Colleges, Assemblies, and Convocations; wheras contrarily he ought to haue been a good Father, and a faithful Administrator of all good Lawes and Customes; but more especially and aboue all, of the stately office of the States.</p>
                  <pb n="19" facs="tcp:177745:11"/>
                  <p>And therefore, ô Princes, if I should proceed to make relation of all the injuries which haue been committed by <hi>Philip</hi> in the Nether<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lands, you might manifestly see and perceiue, that hee intended a most unjust and intolerable government, and that he is driven and pressed to such an intent, by his ambitious desire and extreame hate towards the Netherlanders. I know wel that I speake of things which are sufficiently knowne to the world, and reported of by all men, And that those things which I declare, are better known to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very one, then I am able to conceiue in my minde, or to expresse with my pen. Yet I wil giue you to understand some particulars, although my delivery and abilitie is not any wise able to satisfie your capacitie and knowledge therein. For I cannot remember that there hath ever been in this world a more wicked and vile act heard of then this which <hi>Philip</hi> did, when he not onely intended the separa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and dispersion of the noblest of the States: but also to kil and to haue murthered them: And even at that very time (as I haue said already) when they had brought up unto him the nine yeares subsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die, not onely with an especial and singular good wil, but with a farr greater officiousnesse. As also when he first in a secret counsel had concluded utterly to haue extirpated and eradicated all the Nether<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>landers, which by him and his unjust inquisitors were suspected to be altered in religion.</p>
                  <p>Now to the end I passe not by that in silence; Before <hi>Philip</hi> had accused the States of rebellion, contumacie, and <hi>Crimen lase Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iestatis,</hi> Duke d'<hi>Alva</hi> made declaration unto <hi>Henrie</hi> the second, King of France, that <hi>Philips</hi> intent was not onely to put to executi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Nobles and Gentlemen, but also all those subjects which were suspected to bee of the reformed and pure religion. <hi>Philip</hi> would haue murthered so many thousand people, and would haue butchered them like innocent lambes, which never had given him so much as an ill word; yea who alwayes with an especial Benevo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence and officiousnesse, had most willingly been obedient to his command, over whom hee (after the Emperours departure) had scarcely ruled and governed one yeare. So that if in case he from that time to this present (and according to that cruel and tyranni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal beginning) might haue runne out the course of his tyranny, we had been choked and buried long agoe in our own blood.</p>
                  <pb n="20" facs="tcp:177745:12"/>
                  <p>Which of you, ô Princes, is there that maketh any doubt of the truth hereof, in regard that the King of France whom I even now named, did not spare to advertise the Prince of Orange (when hee with other Princes was concluding the peace of <hi>Passowe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>,</hi> in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>halfe of King <hi>Philip)</hi> that such an exceeding evil act was intended by the wicked counsels of King <hi>Philip?</hi> But I pray you, ô Princes, doe not think that <hi>Philip</hi> undertook this for religion. This was his religion, that he thought it a sin to let any man liue, who did not hold and esteeme for good; yea, and to eat up as suger, all his coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sels and intents. This did his religion permit, and therefore hee made no conscience nor sinne, to haue murthered so many thousand innocent Burgers, to the end that at once all the Nobilitie and chiefe of the Netherlands might haue been made away.</p>
                  <p>He accounted that for no sin at all, in the warres of the <hi>Moriscoes</hi> to apprehend an hundred marchants of <hi>Granado,</hi> and in one night in a tumult to out all their throats and to murther them. Not that they were any way suspected for their religion (for they had been alwayes of the Romish Catholick beliefe) but for their money and great riches: For he that was of the least abilitie among them, was worth fiftie thousand Ducates, which treasure <hi>Philip</hi> presently appoynted to be brought into his treasure and Exchequer.</p>
                  <p>And this is briefly what <hi>Philip</hi> himselfe hath done, as being the head and chiefe Architecture of our miseries. Let us now descend unto the times which followed, after that hee had left the Nether<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lands, and was gone into Spaine. O these were heavy (and by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of the abundance of calamities) most deadly times. Times? The remembrance thereof bringeth a deadly feare, horror, and an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treame detestable abhorring, unto the soules and bodies of all good Patriots and lovers of their countrey. O is not this a miserable case, that the Spaniards, Moriscoes, and Semi-moriscoes, should haue had so much right, or farre rather so much violence, over us? who not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding were ready and prepared not onely to haue left and lost our goods, but even our we<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>fare, wiues, children, and our liues, in the service of the most high God and the King. That we, I say, so suddenly were proclaimed for rebels, and repugnant godlesse he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retickes: And after so many provocations, instigations and injuries, being dejected and throwne down to the ground, not by one cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pion,
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:177745:12"/> nor by one blow, but by many and grievous wounds, could scarcely begge and preserue our liues and soules of our pestilent enemie.</p>
                  <p>Let us now a little observe these champions one after another, according as the ensuing times shall declare and manifest the same, which <hi>Philip</hi> sent out of Spaine to be supreame Lords of the Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therlands; not that they should be as wholsome and medicinable restoratiues to our wounds: but that they as biting corrisiues (sent from the shop and store-house of all deceit and wickednesse) might bite open, and make them greater and more dangerous.</p>
                  <p>Now if that be true which politicians affirme, that a man may know and discerne the nature and affection of the Prince, by the condition and manners of his friends, and of those which he useth for counsel and service; Then let us consider and see of what quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie and condition the King of Spaine is, by those governors and ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers which haue been sent from him into the Netherlands. For when <hi>Phillip</hi> had layd the fast foundation and ground-work of his cruel and tyrannical government, hee concluded to returne againe into Spaine, to the end that the Netherlanders might indure and suffer all kind of misery at the hands of such as were their fellow-servants; And that the King as being himselfe absent, might pretend and hold himselfe as ignorant thereof.</p>
                  <p>And first <hi>Margaret</hi> the Princesse of <hi>Parma,</hi> had the government of these lands. She was a craftie queane, and exceeding desirous to further the Spanish tyranny, who by her manifold and continual complaints and accusations, aggravated the kings hatred more and more: The king had joyned in commission with her the Cardinal <hi>Gran-velle</hi> (a man farre exceeding and surpassing her in perversnesse, deceit, contention, in understanding and courage) to be her coadju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor and companion in this passage of Spanish tyranny.</p>
                  <p>These two were the Princes and Architectures of so many com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>motions. All the civil warres were hatcht, effected and begun by these two. And like as <hi>Helena</hi> was unto the <hi>Troiancs,</hi> even so were these two to our Reipublick, the occasion of warre, the occasion of plagues and spoyle.</p>
                  <p>For that which before was very hard for <hi>Philip</hi> to effect by vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment force and violence, that effected these two, by deceit, by trap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pings
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:177745:13"/> and underminings. For when they at the first did perceiue that they could not effect their intent, but under a shadow and co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour of religion to doe all things contrary to our lawes and privile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges. Then they erected new Bishops by a new trick which was un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>usual in the Netherlands. And these were set as spies in the great and principal cities, both in all general and particular affaires. They es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pied and revealed what every man intended and practised. Those that were but suspected of neglecting the Romish religion, they pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently haled and cast them into prisons or dungeons, and thence to most cruel punishments; and finally, brought them to death, confis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cating their lands and goods to the Exchequer. And this was the chiefe occasion, that the greatest part of all those that imployed all their endevours and diligence to stand for the common good, and seemed to preferre, as also to place and exalt the publick libertie and just lawes before the vile and contemptible enterprises of the Spani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards; these men were made away.</p>
                  <p>This was that holy intent of <hi>Philip</hi> and his Spaniards; This was that holy Inquisition, which so called and nominated their most vile deeds, and cruel robberies, which never before had been heard of, nor used in the Netherlands, which directly as water doth contend and striue with the condition and nature of fire, did that oppugne our lawes: because that no man by such meanes might be inforced thereunto, neither by violence nor death; yet by these bloudy judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the Spanish tyranny, even the principal and chiefe defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders of our natiue countrey (by false accusations) even with their wiues and children, were brought to publick punishments of fire and sword.</p>
                  <p>The like used <hi>Tarquinus Superbus</hi> that tyrant (whereof wee spake before) most vehemently to doe in such like affaires; whose customs, manners, and deeds, <hi>Philip</hi> not onely seemeth carefully to aime at; but even by imitation to doe the like. For that Roman tyrant, to the end he might make himselfe feared and respected of all men, took onely notice of the matters of life &amp; death, without any coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sel. And under that pretext, he killed, burnt and executed the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, and confiscated all the goods of those whom he either hated, or had in any suspition; or else from whom he exspected any good booty. And this very same did <hi>Philip</hi> seek to doe, and all the other
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:177745:13"/> his counsellors of mischiefe in the Netherlands; because they per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded themselues that there was nothing more availeable nor fitter to cover their wicked designes, and to discover our intendments and actions (as well in the general as particular affaires) as was this new care of maintaining and manumising of their religion, which they seemed to entertain with exceeding great care and diligence.</p>
                  <p>For there is nothing worse nor more dangerous, there is nothing which usually bringeth unto men more inconveniences and doma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, then that which is pretended and effected under the shew and pretext of some great commoditie and profit. But before I wil pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed to demonstrate how exceeding farre the institutions and the lawes of the Inquisition, opposed our lawes; How exceedingly they weakned our privileges, and the good estate and welfare of our countrey; I wil freely confesse that the Emperour before that time, being moved by the counsel of many, would haue brought that most cruel Spanish Inquisition into the Netherlands, and would haue in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stituted certaine new rigorous lawes concerning the matter of reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion: but when he perceived that those things could not be accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plished without the greatest alteration of our Reipublick and go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment; And that hee understood that all the currant of our lawes were against the same, and made flat opposition: then that good fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and preserver of our countrey, desisted from his intended pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose; and by the good and wholesome advice of the States (who had oftentimes demonstrated unto him wherefore those things could not be established without the great domage and subversion of our lawes and privileges) he left the same undone.</p>
                  <p>So that every one may clearly see and perceiue, that the diligence that this good Prince used therein, and that great care he took ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, that the same should farre rather be for our preservation, and furthering to the common good, then to the hurt of the same.</p>
                  <p>But the Emperour being dead, <hi>Philip</hi> againe erected and establi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed that first intention and counsel of the Inquisition, as a fast foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation and sure fortification of his deceits, and treacherous trap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pings, which so long before had been cast off and rejected by the Emperour. So that it seemed, that he by a violent and strong at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt, would quite subvert the state of our Reipublick, with his most pestilent lawes. For he having despised the advice, counsels,
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:177745:14"/> reasons and the petitions of our States and of our lawes, he willed and commanded that it should be so. That new Bishops should be instituted and ordained over the great cities. These having dimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished the revenues of many Abbots, as also the Lawes and privile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges of the principal of the Clergie, but more especially having weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned and deposed the Bishop of Camerick, and the Bishop of Leige, they lived more sumptuosly and gorgeously then they. He ordained that there should be nine Canons adjoyned unto them, that should be of the same stuffe, and of the same condition and na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture as the others were. Out of these nine especially should there be three sought out, of the most severe and cruellest of them all; who daily with great earnestnesse should look into the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faires of the Inquisition. And that which was farre worse, and more intolerable for our libertie, these Bishops should not onely be mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers in the Assembly of the States; but even there should haue the most voyces.</p>
                  <p>By this meanes these confusers and disturbers of the Netherlan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dish peace and tranquilitie, did easily oppose the best and profitablest lawes and counsels of the States, and did weaken and debilitate the same even as it pleased King <hi>Philip.</hi> They were able and ready to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme the Spaniards (who were enemies to our countrey) all what the States intended. For the meaning and intention of <hi>Philip</hi> when he ordained them, and admitted them into the Assembly of the States; was, that they should not consent to their wholesome and good counsels; neither if that they could advise or counsel any thing of themselues to the welfare of the common good; that they should doe it; But that he by them, might confuse, destroy, and breake the unitie of our States, and their uniformitie of voyces in counselling; And to bring such a kind of counselling in treyne, which might be most serviceable for his tyranny.</p>
                  <p>Hence you may sufficiently understand, <hi>O most peaceful and illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strious Princes,</hi> the reasons that the States had, and were inforced to deny and detest that new intent and meaning of <hi>Philip,</hi> and how the same opposed our lawes. Yea and were it for no other, but for this onely cause, yet it must needs distate and utterly dislike them; That strange Spaniards and Italians might be chosen for such Bishops.</p>
                  <p>We saw and heard daily in our Assemblies and counsel of State
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:177745:14"/> the filth and dregges of these strange fellowes, who were exceeding farre estranged from the nature of the Netherlanders: whereas our lawes had concluded and commanded (as we haue sayd before) that at no time ever in the Netherlands it should happen, that it was law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful for the Prince to admit any stranger into the Assembly of the lands affaires or counsels. By this subtiltie and deceit <hi>Philip</hi> sought to bring in other lawes, which might annihilate our lawes, and set up his in their place. and to haue a new councel in the assembly of the States: for he could not make use of the counsell of the States for the furthering of his tyranny. Moreover I doe not intend to passe by the incredible crueltie and severitie of this new institution of these three inquisitors, or under-questors, which daily they pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctised.</p>
                  <p>We saw daily these three hellish Iudges keep cruel courts of Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice by themselues, which was differing from the courts of the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and of the Provinces. They despising the common authoritie of the Magistrates, prosecuted after a new manner of law against the offenders, as they termed them; and therein did accuse and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demne, without admitting any, yea the least meanes for them to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer for themselues, without suffering any appeale or challenge to the higher powers, but used their owne authoritie and their owne advice, and so proceeded as it pleased their owne liking and fanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie, and used (to please their owne appetite) such un-heard-of and unaccustomed punishments, upon the bodies and liues of such per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, whereof they did but dreame that they had violated or vilified the Romish religion: or else they themselues by their most villanous deceits, and trecherous trickes, had induced and set on others to doe something, by which meanes they might be suspected to haue been altered in their religion. For they had a custome to set out daily cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine stationers with bookes and writings which did oppose the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mish Religion, and sent these fellowes to the Nobles and chiefe of the Prouinces, to the end, that if they did but buy any of the same, that then presently, as being offenders, for heresie, and of a false re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, they might accuse them and condemne them. Like as it is reporred of that cruel and blood-thirsty beast <hi>Hyana,</hi> who for to entice the people, or such as kept the cattle, to come out of the woods or sheltring places to them, made great mourning and la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentation,
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:177745:15"/> to the end she might deveure them.</p>
                  <p>Is not this, most illustrious Princes, to abuse religion, godlinesse and piety to tyranny? Is not this to alter and change the State of the Reipublick, and to bring in any novelties which might oppose the lawes or the authoritie of the States in them, according to the wil and pleasure of <hi>Philip?</hi> Is not this to punish a culpable Citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zen with amercements, bands, o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> blowes, contrary to the lawes of the land, and contrary to the authority and respect of the magistrate? Finally, is not this to prosecute the offenders by a course of justice contrary to the lawes and customes of the cities, or of the publicke courts, and to deny a man the libertie to make his owne defence.</p>
                  <p>If then we must consent unto <hi>Philip,</hi> and to the Pope (which I utterly deny) that for the altering of religion in the Netherlands, such crueltie and bitternesse must be used. Yet we say (that which many with us wil testisie) that many Netherlanders were most cruelly butchered, which knew no other religion, nor made confession of no other religion but the Romish religion, and these that knew not wherfore they were condemned to death: in regard also they never had trespassed against the lawes of the Inquisition.</p>
                  <p>And considering, ô Princes, that all the complaints and accusati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons which <hi>Philip</hi> maketh against us, doe for the most part, consist chiefly herein, that he acknowledgeth and confesseth to haue used, not onely this bringing in of the Inquisition, but also this long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>during warre, burnings, fierings, butcherings, and the like, as a sure medicine and helpe, for the rooting out of heresie, and for a special care that he taketh for the Romish religion, and the maintenance thereof. Yet harken I pray you with attention to that which I more amply shall declare unto you of this matter, by which very clearly you may see and perceiue how exceedingly his excessiue great subtil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, policies, dissimulations and hypocrisies doe maske themselues, and lurk under this name of the Romish religion, and how provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently and subtilly <hi>Philip</hi> abuseth his religion.</p>
                  <p>You know that in former time the Roman Emperours, when the Roman Empire began to decline, used and took unto themselues, in their titles the Name, and in their deeds the Authority &amp; Dignity of the greatest Pontifices or chief Priests: And now you see <hi>Philip,</hi> who for the enlarging and establishing of his Government, sets up all his
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:177745:15"/> sailes to saile withal, and roweth with all manner of Oares: For though he attributeth not unto himselfe the vain and bare name of the Pope of Rome? yet for all that he defineth and limiteth the Popes will and authority, with his will and pleasure; yea, with his desires and endevours: So that which once that famous and most excellent Poet <hi>Virgil</hi> said; That <hi>the Emperour Augustus possessed a divided Kingdome with Iupiter their chiefe god:</hi> we may with more right and reason say of <hi>Phillp;</hi> That he with that great government of the Pope of Rome, hath so fast bound and annexed his there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto, and hath so established and under-propt his intents, counsell, and will, with his wil and suffrages; that the Pope must hold for good, consent and command, all what he will. In such manner, that we may well affirme; that this power and dignity of the Pope of Rome, in very deed is nothing else, but the Oracle of <hi>Delphos</hi> which alwaies <hi>Phllippeth.</hi> For when <hi>Phillip</hi> is desirous of any great Kingdom, or mighty Lands of other Princes, which might be ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viceable unto him; let him but make the Pope therwith acquainted, and write unto the Pope and his counsels of Cardinals, willing and commanding, that for the neglect or violating of Religion, the King of <hi>France,</hi> or the Queen of <hi>England</hi> be no longer tollerated in their Kingdomes; that the Lawes and Priviledges of the <hi>Nether<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>landers</hi> may be subverted; that they themselues might be afflicted with grievous punishments; that they may be executed, and their goods may belong to them that ceaze upon them; that is, that they may be mine: this great <hi>Iupiter</hi> shall presently consent, and as it were with this godly rod of correction, giue unto this Plaintiffe <hi>Phillip</hi> the possessions of all the other. And this they thinke to be a suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient and lawful occasion for the making of a warre, and for the exercising of all cruelty; and for the swallowing up of yours, the next-adjacent mighty Kingdomes; and our Lawes and Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges.</p>
                  <p>And thinke not that the Pope, or his Cardinals, may, will, or dare deny, or gaine-say <hi>Phillip</hi> in that, in regard, that the Cardinals, for the most part, are made upon that condition, that they may sel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom or never gain-say or oppose; but alwaies are to condiscend to the entent and desires of <hi>Phillip.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I speak the truth, ô Princes, and you know that it is so indeed, that <hi>Phillip</hi> ruleth, not simply with words in the Councel at Rome,
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:177745:16"/> but he hath brought such manner of men into the same, who haue assuredly promised to assist his Government, and intention, both in word and deed: that he giveth and sendeth unto many of the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinals (though I will not say that he yearly doth maintain them) ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding great gifts: that he oftentimes threatneth the Pope and the Cardinals with his displeasure and indignation, and publiquely saith, That he wil make tryal of, and repair unto other Defendors of the Romish Religion, if in case they deny him that which he desireth for the establishing of his tyrannie: For he wil haue all his most wicked enterprises, surprizings, oppressions, murthers &amp; tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, shal be published, esteemed &amp; held for good works by the Pope of Rome. He thinketh it is an injurie done unto him, that any man, in what case soever, should speak against him, in regard he so high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly esteemeth his own Authority, Majestie, and Dignity in such man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, that the prosperity of all Christendom; yea, the welfare, life, liberty, house and home, the meanes and good fortune of all men, of beliefe and power, must be concredited and attributed unto his holinesse.</p>
                  <p>These Popes <hi>Sixtus Quintus,</hi> and <hi>Gregorie</hi> the foureteenth, thun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred out of their <hi>Mausolaeum</hi> of <hi>Trajanus,</hi> their impotent flashings and lightnings, against the person, kingdom, and possession of the King of <hi>France, Phillip</hi> made use of these occasions for a future warre: When Pope <hi>Sixtus</hi> the fifth (who was wiser and of a liberal disposition) being afterwards aware of his ginns, traps and deceits, revoked the excommunications, envies, hatred and enmity. He here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by seemed exceedingly to favour the King of <hi>France</hi> against <hi>Phillip,</hi> by which meanes he not onely purchased the evil wil and the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treme hatred of all Spaniards, but also therby brought his own life to an end, Two yeares before, <hi>Phillip</hi> had effected and brought to passe by meanes of this Pope, that all Christians, that should pray an houre or two every day upon their knees in the Churches before the Altar, for the peace of France, that they therfore should haue and obtain, certain thousand yeares remission of all their sinnes? And yet for al this, he was not ashamed in the mean while to hinder, let; yea, and to forbid, that the Pope should giue no audience unto the Legacies or Embassage of the Cardinal <hi>Gondius,</hi> with the Marshal of <hi>Pisa,</hi> and the Duke of <hi>Nevers,</hi> who were dispatched and sent
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:177745:16"/> thither about the peace in <hi>France.</hi> Beside this, he commanded that his Embassadours should presently depart as enemy out of Rome, as soon as those Embassadours of peace should be admitted and to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerated in the Citie of Rome. But what a mischievous work, and most wicked and impudent counsel was that of <hi>Phillip,</hi> which he after so many secret conspiracies, privy intrappings, or rather con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealed treacherous covenants, gaue himselfe in France to publicke robberie and paracide, as the murthering of a kinsman; Who by his and other mens counsel and help, under the promise of an oath, procured to Popish Priest or Frier, being suted in the habite of a spiritual person, with a very friendly countenance and familiar cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage, without any anger or shew of impatiency, without being aba<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>hed by reason of any fear, did sheath his knife in the body of that great King of France, who was of the bloud and kinred of the King of Spain? Neither haue these Spanish parasites and flatte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers, feared to nominate and cal this abominable deed, with that fair and goodly name, saying, <hi>That it was a stab given from heaven.</hi> This paracide and murderer of the King is accounted and reckoned among the number of Saints. His friends and kinred (as out of dust and dirt, even from their vile, base, and contemptible estate,) by the recommendation, command, and assistance of <hi>Phillip,</hi> are ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced to great estate, and to a Cardinals dignity.</p>
                  <p>Those secret and lurking traps of treacherie, and those pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick combustious flames of Christendom, which he cannot cleare, uphold and maintain, by humane or publick justice; those, his pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stilent dominion seeketh to cleare, free and acquit, with the vizard and colourable deceit of Religion, and the Catholike name. And therfore wil I by your patience, ô Princes (having no desire to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vile, calumniate nor traduce, but out of an ardent desire of piety, and a longing desire to confesse the truth) declare unto you, how many evil parts, paracides, and lascivious lustfulness doe lurk in <hi>Phil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lips</hi> own family, which altogether are vailed, shrouded, masked and covered, with the Catholike name and Religion, and are accounted for holy and pious deeds.</p>
                  <p>To the end that he might leaue a sonne, and a lawful inheritance to all his great kingdomes; He, by an holy and pious dispensation, had so much leaue, that he might tyrannically murther or make a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:177745:17"/> his owne lawful wise, being the daughter and sister of the kings <note place="margin">Note here the tyrants crueltie.</note> of France; and in her place to marry his owne Neece, unto whom he was uncle.</p>
                  <p>By the Popes dispensation it was lawful for <hi>Philip</hi> (and that for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sooth for an holy intention) to make away his owne son <hi>Charles</hi> the Prince of Spain; because he seemed to be favourable and well<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>affected to the Lawes and Liberties of the Netherlanders: because also hee did not altogether seem to consent to the deaths and mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therings of many Princes; and because that he said that the Nether<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>landish Provinces were his, and that they were given him at his Baptism.</p>
                  <p>It was also lawful for <hi>Philip</hi> to haue two wiues' at one time aliue, in one and the same bonds of Matrimony, <hi>viz.</hi> the Queen of <hi>Portu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal,</hi> and the Lady <hi>Isabella Osoria.</hi> And what work of proper and pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar dishonestie was not branded upon his life? What shameful reproach and stain of immodesty is there, which doth not cleaue and adhere unto his name? Yet for all these, he knowes how to arme, and how to defend and patronage the same, with that ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable and pious title of the Catholike King. Is this the man that wil invoke, inforce, and oblige others to piety, and to the exercising of Religion? Dare he for his Religion, undertake and prosecute a warre against the Religion of all men? Can he by most cruel, and the like not heard-of punishments, purge and absolue, the Religion of all France, England, Netherland, and all Christen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, wheras he himselfe is spotted and tainted with so many ill properties?</p>
                  <p>I think now, ô Princes, that you doe sufficiently understand that <hi>Phillip</hi> at no time, ever resolved nor concluded to defend, reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence and obey the Romish Religion; but it was to serue his owne turn, under the shew and pretence of some piety, for the defend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of some of his notorious and vile abuses, and for all acciden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal matters and occasions, which might befal his unjust and ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious government.</p>
                  <p>What think you then, that the Netherlanders could any longer tolerate and endure such like cruelties? By the which all sorts of people; yea, even the very noblest and chiefe of the Nobles and Gentrie (as if they had been beasts, without either reason or speech)
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:177745:17"/> by false accusations of neglecting the Religion (even to the great rejoycing of all Spaniards) should be da<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>ly butchered, to the end that our Priviledges, to the end that our Lawes, to the end that our Libertie should perish and be lost, and that with their liues, all those that sought to desend or maintain the same, should die and pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish? Was it possible that we could endure this tyrannie any longer, ô Princes? Was this to maintain Religion? Was this vizard and cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lourable deceit of piety, even to the subversion of our liberty and liues, longer to be maintained and to be accepted for good? I doe not think that any man will say so. Therfore meer necessitie, and the welfare of all the Netherlanders at the long-last required, that the States in these grievous accidents, should begin to assist their Rei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>publick, thus tending to ruine; and to resist the most cruel intenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the most barbarous men. Neither doe the States thinke, as yet, upon any violence, Armes or warre: but being more patient in suffering wrong, then it is possible for any man to beleeue, they goe that way, and take the course; that is, of right and reason: and with the greatest modestie that possible might be, they desire in a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quest or petition to the Dutchesse of <hi>Parma,</hi> and doe admonish her; that if she wil not utterly destroy the Reipublik, that she must leaue off that new and uncredible rigour and severity of the Inquisition; and to moderate and slacken a little that extreme raging furie: but they were despised of her, and opposed with up-braidings and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vilings: they were called <hi>Geuses,</hi> that is, beggars? What people were these? Such people (or else I would I might not liue) who for the liberty of the Reipublick, and for the Law of our Country, desired nothing else, but that which in all equity and good right they were bound to do. By what maner of people were they thus reviled? By such men indeed, which neither did excel them in Nobility of birth, nor in the aboundance of Riches; but in the abilitie of their minds, in counsel and valour, far unworthier then these excellent men and defenders of their natiue Countrey were. Peradventure you wil alledge that they were subjects. What then? Did ever good Prince set at naught the petitions and desires of his subjects? As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suredly King <hi>Artaxerxes Minemon</hi> the brother of <hi>Cyrus,</hi> did not onely take leasure, and attend, to hear all those that desired any thing of him, but commanded also his Queen, that wheresoever
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:177745:18"/> she should be, to take away the Curtaines or Tapistry of her Coach or Chariot of State, to the end that all those that would, might the more conveniently speak unto her. <hi>Titus Vespasion</hi> said, <hi>That he had lost a day, when he had not daily bestowed some benefit or other upon some of his subjects.</hi> But yet let us giue way and assent unto this abuse and revilings of the disdainful and shamefully pufft-up-proud Spaniard: Let us far rather consider into what danger our Reipub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick is brought; As also that neither the long continued patience, nor those most modest petitions of the States, could any whit mittigate or mollifie that Arrogancie and Contumacy.</p>
                  <p>The chiefe and best Lovers of our Liberty; the principal of the Lords doe persevere; they make sute almost to every Spaniard that that was at Court, that was of any special respect or note, and gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth them to understand the distressed estate of the Common-weal, praying and intreating them, that they would giue the Dutchesse and the King to understand in their counsel and by letters, what a darke and smoking shew of civil-broiles and dissentions, threatned the most flourishing Reipublick with great miseries and calamities; if he did not moderate and slacken those cruelties, bloud-sheddings, banishments, and that robbing of their goods. But when as they af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter a long time, by this meanes could effect nothing, they sent the Earle of <hi>Egmond,</hi> as Embassadour unto the King, who with letters from the States, and by word of mouth, might relate unto the King, the state of the Reipublick. The King granted and promised unto him, that he would make that all things should goe wel, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the wish of all the Netherlanders: but in the letters that he gaue this Embassadour, he threatned the States with more grievous punishments. And afterward, when the Emperour <hi>Maximilian</hi> the second, and all the Princes of the Empire, being moved &amp; entreated by the <hi>Netherlanders,</hi> to doe them this benefite, that they would in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tercede, intervein, and speak for them unto King <hi>Phillip,</hi> and the Spaniards; to knit up, and to establish the peace. They got for their answer; they should take care for their own affaires, the King knew wel enough how, and in what manner he must rule over his Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects.</p>
                  <p>Yet let us omit these light matters, if it be a light matter, after such a peremptory and puffed-up manner to answer an Emperour
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:177745:18"/> so, and to disdain the Authority (or respect) and the Recommenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of such Princes. If it be a light matter to disdain a Prince, the Embassadour of the <hi>Netherlands;</hi> and with vain pretences to salue up his mouth. And let us far rather speak of those matters, whose viciousnesse maketh them heavie.</p>
                  <p>All this while the States perceiving that <hi>Phillips</hi> cruel tyrannizing increased, and came to an unmeasurable greatness; they intreated the Dutchesse, that with her wil, authority and respect, they might for the second time send Embassadours unto the King, <hi>viz.</hi> the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quis of <hi>Berghen,</hi> and the Baron of <hi>Montigney;</hi> to the end that they by their Orations, Intercessions, and Intreaties might mollifie and mittigate the exceeding great obdurateness of the Kings cruel minde, which made him altogether unfencible.</p>
                  <p>But what became of these Embassadours? Were they (as the manner is) presented with any gifts, or otherwise honoured? Were they answered? Were their desires granted; or, that which cannot be denyed by no Law, were they at least honourably discharged? O no; the Marquis was made away with poyson; and <hi>Montigney</hi> was carryed away by <hi>La Motto</hi> and <hi>Medina,</hi> and was publiquely be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>headed: and after this manner were the Embassadours of the <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therlands;</hi> after this manner were these illustrious persons, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter this manner were those good Patriots made away, and exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted.</p>
                  <p>Now the <hi>Spaniards</hi> doe not any longer rend and teare the Civil Lawes; but the Law of Nature; the Law of Nations is by them violated, scandalized and broken. What need I say more? To what end should I proceed further to demonstrate and proue that our warre is lawful and holy against <hi>Phillip?</hi> Considering that this one wicked act; this deed worthy to be punished, doth sufficiently de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serue and merit, not onely to defend our selues, but that we our selues once may hope to suppresse that Tyrant himselfe in his own Kingdom of Spain. For this our manner of dealing, this lawful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of our warre doth shine unto all Nations of the earth, even from nature it selfe, yea, it is tolerated even of the immortal God himselfe.</p>
                  <p>If any Embassadour of the Romanes by any manner of meanes were endamaged (if he were not publickly satisfied) the custome of
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:177745:19"/> the Romanes was to proclaim warre against that Citie; and because that their Embassadours were proudly resisted in the Citie of <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinth,</hi> they razed the Citie topsey-turvey. Because that their <hi>Fidenish</hi> Embassadour, by the command of <hi>Laertes Tolumnius</hi> King of <hi>Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ento</hi> was executed, they set up the pictures of them, and promised great summes of mony to them that could apprehend of them; and finally they be g<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="2 letters">

                     </gap>t the Citie and people of <hi>Viento</hi> with a siege, and with bloudy warre. The same Citie haue the <hi>Tarentines,</hi> by a cruel warre brought under the yoke of their government, because that they had handled their Embassadours somewhat too saucily. But we passe by those things which haue happened neer at hand, and goe to matters which haue been done far from us.</p>
                  <p>Because that in our time <hi>Fregosius</hi> and <hi>Rinas</hi> Embassadours of the King of <hi>France</hi> were put to death, the Emperour using connivance, or rather annuence in the acting of that inhumane deed, almost all Christendom was set on fire by that war. For the <hi>Romanes</hi> had shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by their example or fore-act, and by their most provident deeds in former times, what the Emperor in such an horrible matter ought to haue done; for they delivered <hi>Manlium</hi> and <hi>Minutium</hi> over to the enemy, because they somewhat too lewdly had abused their Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bassadours, the which by the <hi>Fecial,</hi> or Law of Arms was forbidden.</p>
                  <p>And that Law for abusing Embassadours is not onely established by human Laws, but also by the Law of God, like as the holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture testifieth unto us. For assuredly I know, that never any Prince, with greater severity, did revenge the death, or the abuse of his Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bassadours more then did King <hi>David</hi> (the godly Prophet of the most high God) against <hi>Hanun</hi> King of the <hi>Ammonites;</hi> Because that they abusing his Embassadours, had shaved off the halfe of their beards, and cut off their garments in the middle.

But the day would fa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>le me if I should repeat all the acts of such like deeds. As of <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius Varrus</hi> (who was accounted for a very severe Iudge) had wont to say, when witnesses were produced, and also others named: These Witnesses (saith he) are sufficient, or else I know not what may be sufficient. So haue I produced examples or fore-deeds sufficiently to proue, how horrible ill it is for a Prince,
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:177745:19"/> as also for all men to put to death the Ambassadour of a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monaltie; and that such an evil deed ought to be punished with war and with death. Certainly the name of an Embassadour ought to bee so respected, and of such dignity, that those who beare the name thereof, ought to be free, not onely within the Iurisdiction of their confederates, but even in the midst of the arrowes, swords, pikes, and shot of their enemies.</p>
                  <p>Verily if ever, or at any time it happened, that any barbarous man or Prince, were moved either by necessity, or by any other occasion, to put to death the Ambassadors of their enemies, they haue done the same then either privately or covertly by some secret plot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting; but <hi>Philip,</hi> that inhumane tyrant of all Christendome (I can no longer refrain my selfe from giving him that name) <hi>Philip</hi> (I say) at what time the Ambassadour of his subjects, an obedient peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and no enemies, came unto him, is by sentence of the Iudges, publickly condemned, and caused openly to be beheaded by the Executioner. Wherefore? Because he was come unto him with a supplication or request for the welfare of his natiue countrey; with a legacie or Embassage, as Embassadour of the Netherlands.</p>
                  <p>Could the Netherlanders then affect, loue, and be obedient unto his government? Alas, alas, yes, as if they had quite forgotten all those injuries, they longed and wished daily for his comming, for to enjoy his presence was all their vehement and earnest desire. For both by letters and by Ambassadors the king at divers times most earnestly was sought unto; that he would once againe returne into the Netherlands; and that he himselfe might see and perceiue, with what good wil and affection every one was ready to entertaine, and to obserue his honest and reasonable precepts and commandements. So that if there were any thing, that either the crueltie, or the male<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volence of those great commanding Lords, could not performe nor dispatch, then he himselfe might order and redresse the same. Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally, if there were any thing, which either by the negligence or care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesnesse of his subjects was decayed; that he by his moderation and Benevolence might reestablish and bring into a better course.</p>
                  <p>At the long-last it was verily beleeved that the States by their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treaty had allured the king thereunto, that he promised to returne into the Netherlands, and to performe all this. O what joy, mirth,
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:177745:20"/> and rejoycing was then aboundantly powred into the minds of all the Netherlanders? With what great good wil and desire did they look for their king and Prince? How great and exceeding costly was all the preparation and provision of the nobilitie? How did the hearts of the commonaltie then leape and dance in their bellies for joy? And who is able to recken up the super-abounding charges which the whole Reipublik by their especiall bounty and loue, did free-willingly poure out, for the furnishing and sumptuous pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vision of two Fleets, the one fleet to fetch the King himselfe with his Nobles that accompanied him, and his servants and guard that attended him; which fleet was exceedingly provided, and furnished aboundantly with all delicate provision; and rode at anker in Spain, attending to receiue the king, when it should please him, and to bring him over. The other Fleet was in Zealand, ready prepared for the greater securitie and magnificent state, to haue met the King at sea, as soone as he should haue gone aboord the other fleet in Spain.</p>
                  <p>The affections, good-wils, and the especial loue of the Nether<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>landers unto the King, was so great, that although they had been di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sturbed, moved, and affrighted with his government, with so many evils and injuries; and by his precepts and commandements were brought into so many and great perils and dangers; that yet for all these they wished for him (whom in his continual absence they did reverence with all officiousnesse) to see him in their natiue countrey, in their Reipublick, that they might behold, receiue, and embrace him with the armes of their benefits.</p>
                  <p>I haue according to my abilitie made relation of most of those things which happened under the government of <hi>Margaret</hi> Dut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chesse of <hi>Parma.</hi> Now there remaineth to declare some things which happened under the Duke of <hi>Alva.</hi> And first, this I wil say of him, That like as it is sayd of <hi>Hannibal</hi> of <hi>Carthage,</hi> that hee as yet being but a child of nine yeares of age, made an oath unto his father be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the altar, that he for ever would be enemy unto the Romanes; even so it seemeth that naturally this <hi>Alva</hi> was born and brought up to hate us, to spol us, and to be our destruction. For he came not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to our countrey as others did, to be viceroy, or the Kings Lieute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant; but came praunsing into our confines, as an enemy with a great hoast of armed Spaniards, and other old Souldiers, out of the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:177745:20"/> and garrisons of Sicilia, Naples, and Milaine. The King had given him in charge, that hee with all earnestnesse should goe on and proceed to disturbe, pervert, and confound the order, and instituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of our government. And that he both privately and publickly, should execute every one which resisted his government, and should make away all those who in the least ceremony, omitted, or negle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted rhe Romish religion. The King placed this General in such au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie over the Netherlands, although hee were not of his bloud nor kindred, although that our lawes require that the Governour (as is before sayd) must be of the blood and kindred of the Prince. Yet for all this, the Netherlanders receiue him, with the greatest re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect and dignitie, and admitted him with the greatest obedience and submission into their Reipublick and cities, as soon as they under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood, that the care and charge of their defence was given and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted unto him, by their King, Prince, or chiefe Lord. But as soon as the Duke of Alva came into the cities of the Netherlands, inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to bring us into all kinde of misery and calamitie; He took an other course, after another maner and fashion then the former did to effect and bring to passe the kings wil &amp; command. For first, he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently banished, dispersed, &amp; droue away al the Chiefes, the principal of the Nobles, out of all the Provinces of the Netherlands, who had subscribed their names in that request or petition, or those that had banded themselues in that covenant to maintaine the libertie of their natiue countrey, not unlike those who had suffered themselues to be shot up in the Trojane horse.</p>
                  <p>And although during the government of the governante of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma, an innumerable company of people were executed for religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on with fire, water, sword, and other shameful deaths; yet he thought that way and meanes not to be good enough, but thought that there was another way to be found out by which many more might be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecuted. And therefore he ordained another counsel which should haue the authoriti<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

This counsel they named with its proper name, <hi>The bloodie Counsell.</hi> And although that by this counsel he had cut the throats and liues of so many men; that it seemed, they wold almost fil the Netherlands with the bloud of the most innocent men; yet could not that most

So that I am verily perswaded, that <hi>Alva</hi> thought to make his name famous by crueltie, in regard he accoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted crueltie for such honor and commendation. Like as we read of <hi>Lucius Sulla,</hi> who boasted himselfe in the <hi>Trium-virat,</hi> that hee had caused foure legions of the other side to be executed, which had yeelded up themselues in a common field upon his promise; and that he had done other cruel deeds.</p>
                  <p>But among all the acts which are most remarkable that were done by the helpe and conduction of the Duke of <hi>Alva,</hi> whereof he most boasteth, and for which he most vaunteth himselfe, was, that he by false accusation, for rebellion and contumacie, had condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned two of the most noblest Lords, viz. the Earles of <hi>Egmond</hi> and <hi>Horne,</hi> and certaine other Nobles of great houses, and had caused them publickly to be executed by the hang-man at <hi>Brussels,</hi> O how bitter were these executions to our natiue countrey! How grievous were they to all honest and true-hearted people! Yet all that what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever I shal speak of <hi>Alva,</hi> and of all the other commanders of the Netherlanders; or haue spoken of them, you must, ô Princes, so un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand the same, &amp; perswade your selues, that they neither attemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, nor performed any thing which was not onely according to the wil and knowledge of <hi>Philip,</hi> but was also by his counselling put in execution. For the posts and messengers of this counsel rode stil to and fro. And if all these things had not been done by the wil and counsel of the King, which these commanders and counsellors did; he would not indeed so haue honored, advanced, &amp; rewarded them, with honors, offices, and rewards, as signes and tokens of their good carriage, when he called them home out of the Netherlands.

                  <p>So that I assuredly perswade my selfe, that <hi>Alva</hi> confesseth him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe that he by the command and commission of his King <hi>Philip,</hi>

The States also seeing that their natiue countrey was much weakned by the cruelty and rigor of warre, cea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed not to counsel and advise to peace and unitie. Oh that this coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sell and advice to the Spanish peace, had never entred into the mindes and thoughts of the States: but that all their affections had much rather been united everlastingly, alwayes and without cea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing, to haue assaulted, opposed, and by warre to haue attempted a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the Spaniard. Our Reipublick had then stood &amp; flourished, &amp;
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:177745:34"/> the enemy with all his wicked imaginations and treacheries, with shame and dishonour had fallen.</p>
                  <p>For wheras in the affections of our <hi>Netherlands</hi> remained yet cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain sparkes of the former loue and inclination, to the King of their Reipublick? so they, with an especial and careful modesty, and milde meekness, desired and propounded the most lawful and just conditions of peace, which the Spaniard promised alwaies to keep and maintain unviolably. But they had promised that upon a false and dissembling ground, to the end that they might take some ease, and might rest by that meanes from the warre; and afterwards might with the greater violence and force renew and begin the warre again. For in that same yeare did this most cruel enemy run over the whole <hi>Netherlands</hi> with his Armes: The Souldiers were inforced to setire into the distressed Townes; all the good Citizens and Burgers, were robbed and spoyled of all their gold, silver, and all their other meanes: and <hi>Antwerpe</hi> was so wholly, so miserably, and so pittiful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly spoyled, burnt and destroyed: that even the description of this one act of theirs, maketh a whole volume or book in our Chro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicle or book of Remembrances. <hi>Leyden</hi> was for the second time belegred, to the great danger and hinderance of their best and ablest Citizens. Afterward was <hi>Vtrecht</hi> (a great and mighty Citie situate upon the <hi>Rhyne)</hi> used with the like cruelty as <hi>Antwerpe</hi> had beene. Our people then adding and applying to their great heart-griefe, this calamity, to their former calamities; could nor were able any lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger to indure this cruel government: but like men revived, begann their former warre with a valiant Resolution, and so carryed the bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sinesse, that every one had hope and courage that the Reipublick, (the Land and Comonalty) would be brought to good effect.</p>
                  <p>But the <hi>Spaniards</hi> the second time, laid the hand of their deceit upon our hope, and offered peace again unto the <hi>Netherlanders;</hi> wherunto they were the more easily induced, in regard that all ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest and good men haue a loathing and detestation of all those bloud-sheddings and out-rages, which warre occasioneth. The re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance of the former rest, caused them the more earnestly to attend to their peace-counselling, which they very faithfully inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded &amp; entertained; perswading themselues, that therin was no hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrisie nor deceit: For the more honest a man is, the lesse suspition
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:177745:35"/> hath he of another mans dishonestie. So that by the interposing of the Emperour <hi>Maximilian</hi> the second, there was a new peace made and concluded at <hi>Breda;</hi> which peace by the <hi>Spaniards</hi> had the like beginning, and the like event as the former had. For they provided and fortified themselues in the mean while for warre, whose eies were still gazing upon us for our destruction. And that same yeare they surprized the Townes of <hi>Buerin, Leerdam,</hi> and <hi>O<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>

                  <p>All these, and many more the like, betyded us in the time that <hi>Requisenius</hi> ruled and commanded the Reipublick, whom the King thought most fitting and worthy to succeed <hi>Alva</hi> in the government, and in the dealing which he had used, as we haue said before, whom a sudden and unexpected death surprized, cutting asunder the threeds of the first desires and endevourings of this great Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, whilst he was praunsing and gallopping through the treacheries of the Spanish tyrannie.</p>
                  <p>That which the King of <hi>Spain</hi> could not bring to passe by this tyrant, that he assayed to effect by new inventions, and shameful tricks and treacheries of <hi>Hieronymus de Rhoda.</hi> This man was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently after the death of <hi>Requesenius,</hi> appointed by the King to be of the Councel of State at <hi>Brussels,</hi> to the end, that he with them, might rule and govern in one consent, over the Reipublick and common affaires, and that he should correct and punish the muti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, seditions, and uprores of the Spanish Souldiers, who had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroyed <hi>Aelst, Mastricht, Antwerpe,</hi> and the other Cities, with their cruel murthers, burnings, robbings and rovings, the like hath not been heard off. And this business was brought to that passe, that these destroyers were presently published, declared and banished, as being rebels, contemners, and enemies to the King. But not long af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter <hi>Rhoda,</hi> by his Spanish treacheries became himselfe the head of those Rebels. He used the Kings Seal, and despising the States, would publiquely be held for their Governour or Ruler.</p>
                  <p>By this his perfidious dealing were the States exceedingly trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled and offended; so that they all at once did combine themselues, with the Prince of <hi>Orange,</hi> and with the <hi>Hollanders</hi> and <hi>Sea-landers,</hi>
                     <pb n="45" facs="tcp:177745:35"/> concluding, that they must driue all the <hi>Spaniards</hi> out of the <hi>Nether<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lands,</hi> and that they must alwaies resist and oppose them with warres and weapons to their uttermost endevours.</p>
                  <p>In the mean time, neverthelesse, the States forget not their dutiful obedience unto the King: but contrarily doe pray and intreat him very often, most earnestly; that he would send for those Spanish de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroyers, out of the Land; and that he would punish them for their cruelties and insolencies, by which they had distressed the chiefe Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of the <hi>Netherlands.</hi> But what doe they get (I pray you) by their intreaties? The King commends <hi>Rhoda,</hi> and testifieth, that his ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice is very acceptable unto him; and promiseth unto him, and to the rest of the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> such rewards as their deeds should deserue. From whence it manifestly appeareth; that all things which former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly haue been spoken off, haue been first undertaken and attempted by the kings counsel and approbation.</p>
                  <p>Yet when the King perceived that by this meanes nothing could be effected, and that the <hi>Netherlanders</hi> were aware of such treache<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, in such manner, that they seriously prepared themselues for warre: he thought it fitting to take another course with them, and in stead of the Lyons, puts on the Foxes skinne and offereth them peace. The States very faithfully accepted the Peace again, and thought not that other Serpents of Spanish perfiduousness did lurk in that green grasse of peace. For this peace was maintained and kept firm and sure; and was afterward confirmed and ratified by the oath of <hi>Iohn</hi> of <hi>Austria,</hi> (who presently after came into the Countrey) and was so providently, and in such manner determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned and limited by the States, that all the <hi>Netherlanders,</hi> at the long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>last, seemed by these able and worthy good men, to be delivered: And every one then wiped and washed off the teares of Civill warr from their cheeks. This was that pacification or Treaty of peace made at <hi>Gent,</hi> of the which now I wil speak of, and relate unto you the deeds of this <hi>Iohn</hi> of <hi>Austria,</hi> whom the king at that time, had sent as a Governour, or chiefe Lord over the <hi>Netherlands</hi> out of <hi>Spain.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In the mean time let me intreat you, <hi>ô most peaceful Princes,</hi> that you will hear me with a friendly and well-affected minde, the sequel hereof, like as you haue heard me from the beginning; and funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentally
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:177745:36"/> will understand wherfore the <hi>Spaniards</hi> doe most falsely ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuse us; That this peace was violated and broken by us: which ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cusation I hold to be very grievous.</p>
                  <p>Among other Conditions, Lawes and Contracts of this peace, this was one of the chiefest and weightiest: That <hi>Don Iohn</hi> should not admit any <hi>Spaniard</hi> or stranger, nor any of them; by whose counsel and advise it was evidently known, that the Provinces were brought into that extreme spoil, into the Councel: And contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily, he called, and sent for them to him, kept them in his Court, and in his most secret chambers; That <hi>Baptista Taxis,</hi> a most nota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Spie, and enemy of our common affaires, who a little before had been Secretary unto Duke <hi>d'Alva,</hi> who was not onely adjoyned to his privy Councel, but also was made and set over them. Besides him one <hi>Octavius Gonzago</hi> an <hi>Italian,</hi> as also he took unto him one <hi>Escovedo,</hi> a crafty Spanish Fox, unto whom he adjoyned certain <hi>Netherlanders.</hi> But what <hi>Netherlanders</hi> I pray you?

Barlemont, Megan, Hierge, Flojon, Hautepenny, Assonville,</hi> and other plagues of their Countrey, who having ordained the Law of <hi>Lentulus, Cataline</hi> and <hi>Cassius,</hi> established the same with their coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sels and deeds, <hi>viz. That all those that by preserving the Common-wealth would be preserved, should be declared for enemies.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>By this counsel and advice, the <hi>Spaniards</hi> presently, even at the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of this peace, should haue surprized the Town of <hi>Gent,</hi> if the good and profitable counsel, and also the valiant deeds of the States, had not hindred the same; For <hi>don Iohn</hi> himselfe could not refrain nor keep in his hatred and enmity any longer, which he bore to the <hi>Netherlanders,</hi> but had quickly forgot that sacred oath, which he had sworn, upon the Evangelists, before the Bishop of <hi>Shertogen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bosch,</hi> and the Popes <hi>Nuncius,</hi> or spiritual Embassadour.</p>
                  <p>He had promised and sworn; that he would deal with all the souldiers in the <hi>Netherlands,</hi> who were 15000, about their Arreara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, to the end, that they therupon might be discharged; like as in the agreement of the peace had been concluded. And contrarily therunto, he promised the Souldiers, in the Kings behalfe, anew, to haue greater meanes, honours, offices and rewards: and held a most
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:177745:36"/> mischievous counsel with <hi>Fronsberghen</hi> and <hi>Focker,</hi> Collonels of the German souldiers; part of whose wicked counsel he effected, and the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>est being hindred by the States he could not effect.</p>
                  <p>But yet to the end, that you may see and know the ground of this Businesse, I will in few words declare unto you how the matter fell out: For under these two conditions or covenants, <hi>viz.</hi> in main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining of the Romish Religion; and in yeelding lawful obedience to the King, did the whole Treatie of the peace consist.</p>
                  <p>And when the States which had sworn hereunto with an high Oath, then were they presently admitted, that those affaires concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the Land, which presently in the beginning of the treaty of peace were begunne, but could not be concluded upon, that they should be dispatched and concluded in the next assembly of the States.</p>
                  <p>But yet <hi>Don Iohn,</hi> whose affection burned with a lust and long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing desire, by some secret and concealed practice to break the peace, and to begin the warre again, casting all these conditions and promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses at his heeles, made a way for those complaints which <hi>Philip,</hi> and all the former Governours had used as a cloak to cover all their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended wicked imaginations against the Reipublick, <hi>viz.</hi> That the <hi>Hollanders</hi> and <hi>Sealanders</hi> neglected and despised the Romish Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; and by that meanes the commandement of the King was neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected.</p>
                  <p>Vpon this Anvyle did they hammer night and day? they assailed the States, and were exceeding troublesome unto them, counselling them that they altogether should beginne the warres, against <hi>Holland, Sealand,</hi> and the Prince of <hi>Orange,</hi> who was the most eminent Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pion against the unjust government of the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> who indeed had been exceeding beneficial to the whole Common-wealth.</p>
                  <p>In this counsel <hi>Don Iohn</hi> had his eye upon these two objects, which should be exceeding profitable and serviceable to further his intent; that by their Civill warres, the substance and treasure of the land might be exhausted, and they being weakned and bruyied by their own warre, that then hee, with the more ease and convemency might suppresse them together.</p>
                  <p>Wheras he stil persisting with these desires and intreaties, being as it were dasht against a Rock by a Tempest: The States answered
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:177745:37"/> him; that it were better and more profitable for the Common-wealth, That concerning all those matters wherof <hi>Don Iohn</hi> made his complaints, to haue them by a friendly composition decided, and united, in the assembly of the States; and if they could haue im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>printed or perswaded him to haue beleeved the same, we had never fallen into the miseries of a Civil War.</p>
                  <p>For what is more repugnant to the common good, and to all hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Lawes and Iustice; then to try by warre, those controversies, which may be decyded by Right and Reason. <hi>Archidamus</hi> (though no Christian King, but of a stately, honourable and provident Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion) said; That it <hi>was unlawful to take Armes against those, who were willing to haue the matter tryed by Law.</hi> When any injurie had been offered to the Romanes themselues; they did not presently beginne with warres: but did first send <hi>Clarigatum,</hi> that is, they cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed those things that were stollen or taken away, to be more appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rently and manifestly demanded again.</p>
                  <p>But how profitable, good, and wel-ordred is the custome of the Common-wealth of the <hi>Venetians,</hi> which I lately saw and observed; where they will not suffer that the principal Nobles themselues of that flourishing Common-wealth, should contend, chide, or main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain enmity among themselues, for, or about other mens small and petty affaires. But they bring the same into their Senate, or Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cel, and there they desire, pray, and admonish them, that they will remember, and be mindful, that they are all of them Saint <hi>Markes</hi> children (which name they haue given their Reipublick) and that they are brethren, and Burgeses of such a free and happy govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and that it was not beseeming for them, for any particular bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sinesse, to cherish and foster any private dissention or hatred, which might therafter proue to be more general, to the peril and danger of that Reipublick.</p>
                  <p>Which custome aboue all other affaires ought to be used in the affaires concerning the Land, and ought to be esteemed of in all wel-ordered Common-wealths. If this were so, we should not se<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>But now to return to our former purpose, in respect that there are two sorts of warres: the one with words by way of Iustice; the other with violence. The first being proper to men, the second to unseasonable beasts. And that we m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>st necessarily avoide vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, unlesse the course of justice be denyed us. Therfore we must beleeue that the States farre rather would haue decided those con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troversies, by their good and wholesome counsels, by reason and conference; then to make them greater by warre and spilling the bloud of the Citizens. Contrarily <hi>Don Iohn</hi> complaineth of the States very publiquely: He reproues and upbraids them all for Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bels, and then deales with the High-dutch Souldiers no longer by secret dealing in the affaires very prejudicial to the Common-wealth (with whom very cunningly he had long time dealt with all) but then began he very publickly to deal with them; so that the whole discovery of that businesse, by divers intercepted letters, was fully come to the knowledg of the States. And many things they daily saw with their eyes, as first when he removed his Court and family, with his Councel-companions to <hi>Bergen</hi> in <hi>Henegow</hi> (being a very strong Town, and very fit for his conjurations and complottings) and commanded that the same should be provided with a strong Garrison.</p>
                  <p>Moreover, when as he surprized the Castle of <hi>Antwerpe</hi> by Tre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cherie, and did surprize those wel provided and fortified Townes of <hi>Namen</hi> and <hi>Charlemont,</hi> and put a strong guard into them of his own souldiers, thinking therafter by treachery to haue taken in the Town of <hi>Brussels,</hi> So that already the principal and chiefe Cities and Townes, by the great number of his Forts and <hi>Citadels,</hi> were beleagred and oppressed; and then he wholly began to set up him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe against the Reipublick; and also many other things were then done by his advise and motion: wheras he according to his oath, ought to haue advised, that all the souldiers should haue laid down their Armes, and presently to haue departed out of the Country.</p>
                  <p>All which things appearing manifestly to the eyes of the States, who adjudged that the same tended to the subversion of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth; they thought that they were bound continually to keep a good counsel-watch; neither did they turn their eyes aside from the Reipublick, from that time that he sought to haue all the govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:177745:38"/> alone, unto whom they in all officiousnesse (not being moved by any distemperature of minde) sent as Embassadours unto him, <hi>Marolaeus</hi> and <hi>Brusus,</hi> charging them that they should present and shew, their full performance, innocencie, and integrity, and should free them from all suspicion and evil conceit, (the which they most certainly knew, that he mischievously had dissembled,) that the faith that was given at <hi>Gent</hi> should be renued: they should also pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise, that the States should make diligent enquirie, and exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute severe punishment upon those treacherous murtherers and conspirators, who (as he said) laid wait for his life, and had conspired against him; (making a shew and dissembling, as if to prevent the same, he went to <hi>Namen:)</hi> They would aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment his Guard more then those he had already, to the number of three hundred compleat armed men, who should be all of them <hi>Netherlanders,</hi> the which before that time was never offered to any Governour or Ruler. And yet with all these supplicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and intreaties they effected nothing; for there was neither mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>desty nor reason to be found in <hi>Don Iohn.</hi> Nay, he could not bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle nor keep in his own evil arrogancie and audacious passion; but declared the same to <hi>Marollaeus</hi> at the same time of his Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bassage, boasting himselfe, that he now did wholly assure himselfe, and that hee doubted not, but that he had brought under the subjection of his wil and command, the Citie of <hi>Ant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>werpe;</hi> that he had no lack neither of money nor men; that he now had all things in a readinesse, for the furnishing of a warre; and that he with his sword, would purchase unto himselfe a greater authority, power, command and government; then the States had promised and granted him in the pacification of <hi>Gent;</hi> and that it was his will, that these Embassadours should re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port all these things unto the States, for he would not conceale any thing from them that he knew to appertain to this his intent and wil. This matter is undoubtedly sure and certaine, and sufficiently known before this, so that here it is not needfull to produce witnesses. And although it be a very miserable thing, not to be able to deny, and very shameful to be confest; yet I thinke verily that the <hi>Spaniards</hi> themselues (although they be lesse shamelesse then a man would beleeue they are) cannot deny this at any time.
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:177745:38"/>
                     <hi>Don Iohn</hi> had written unto <hi>Tre-longe,</hi> and to his other companions and fellow-workers of his secret trickes and conspiracies, That hee had given as a Cymbrian spoile the wealth of the citizens of Ant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>werpe, for a prey unto his souldiers. The souldiers ranged already through the citie, as mortal enemies, and forced the citizens to giue them whatsoever they listed. Many of the principal citizens began to fly out of the Citie, and as it were banished: by which meanes the traffique and trading of the Marchants by shipping, began to cease. And although there were great and manifest tokens of their malig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant enmity; yet nevertheless the States did beare all this very mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratly and modestly, and indeed would haue born yet much more, if that mortall and pittiful project which <hi>Don Iohn</hi> intended, had not been discovered and made manifest as the day; even as if a man at the first sight seemed to perceiue some liuelesse and insensible crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and afterwards by more certain and sure signes and tokens, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginneth to think of what qualitie that was whereof he doubted: e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven so the States did also very easily understand, by all those things which they had seene, that this prince did cherish in his mind and counsels, an hatred tending to the ruine of the common-wealth: but of what qualitie that he was, and how farre he would extend himself over the reipublick, that they most evidently discerned and distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guished thereafter, both out of his owne, and by letters from others. For there were many letters intercepted in Gasconie, viz. Two of <hi>Don Iohns,</hi> written by himselfe unto the King, and other from him written to <hi>Anthonie Perez</hi> the chirfe of the Kings Councell; More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over fiue letters from <hi>Escovedo</hi> to the King, out of which the States might assuredly understand, that there were fed and bred monsters, and strange impostures; that privat conspiracies were there practised; that there was great dissention mingled among the Cities and the Nobilitie of the Netherlands; and by what meanes the same was ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected; and how fit and serviceable it was that tyrany and the Inqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition, according to that firm resolution of the Spaniards, should be brought in &amp; established; and to that end soldiers, arms, and all war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick preparation very earnestly was required for the king.</p>
                  <p>Consider and understand, <hi>illustrious Princes,</hi> the secret and privie conspiracies of this man: Heare the words which this man useth in his letters written to the King, which (as I sayd before) were inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted.
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:177745:39"/>
                     <hi>In regard that this bodie</hi> (sayth he) <hi>is so unhealthful, that it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be cured any otherwise, but by the cutting off of the unsound members, you must now carefully obserue this occasion which is presented.</hi> And <hi>Es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covedo</hi> adds the unto the rest very amply, as a good interpreter of his meaning, who might very wel write that which <hi>Don Iohn</hi> himselfe would not giue to understand. This <hi>Escovedo</hi> was the right minion and servant of Audacitie and Trecherie, whom I think by reason of his nature and manners, was named <hi>Escovedo,</hi> because that he knew by his deceit to bring, the miserable Netherlanders into his net. He wrot that unto the King which <hi>Don Iohn</hi> would haue him to write, viz. <hi>That it possibly could not be, that the Netherlanders should bee brought under the pure and perfect obedience and will of the King, unlesse that first they were tamed and constrained thereunto with fire and sword. That therefore both men and armes were very needfull, and that the same must be effected by warre.</hi> By the which as a good architecture of the Spanish tyranny, he gaue them to understand, that the crueltie and ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gour which <hi>Alva</hi> and <hi>Requisenius</hi> had abused, must not continually be put in practise, but that the Netherlanders must be ensnared by a greater deceit and hypocrisie. Like as in Navigation, it is a poynt of knowledge to see before hand the storme, that although men can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not attaine the haven, yet (if altering the course) you may attaine thereinto, then it is a foolish deed to keep that course which before was taken with great perill and danger, rather then that you altering the same, might attaine to the wished for haven. For so was his opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, that the first raging and madnesse of the Spaniards must bee somewhat mollified, and now must goe to worke with dissembled faith and promises. That <hi>Don Iohn</hi> who had an incredible modera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and an indifferent minde betwixt Ambition and Crueltie, might very fortunately effect the same. He advised by his owne and his masters counsell, that England should be first surprised and conque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red by warre, and then it would be very easie to surprize the Nether<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>landish provinces.</p>
                  <p>In those letters which <hi>Don Iohn</hi> sent unto <hi>Anthonie Perez</hi> his spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall friend; He gaue him to understand that he was of such a nature and condition, that he could not liue still in idlenesse, nor could a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way with the lawes of peace; and that his mind &amp; conscience could not indure that he should wholly submit himselfe to the privileges
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:177745:39"/> and lawes of the Netherlanders, but that he farre rather by force of Armes would obtaine and effect for the king, a whole, absolute, and unlimited government over the Netherlands.</p>
                  <p>And if now you do not sufficiently see and perceiue, that <hi>Don Iohn</hi> first broke the pacification of <hi>Gent,</hi> where the same by so many and cleare proofes doth appeare. Then remember (by the eternal God) remember, I say, what reasons he used to the Embassadors of our States at <hi>Marche</hi> and <hi>Famines,</hi> when he said, that he would keepe the contracts and conditions of peace so long, until that covenant which was begun, should repent him, that is, untill he by his sweet entisings, and hypocritical lenitie, having rockt the States asleepe, at the last might destroy them, and with them suppresse the whole Rei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>publick. For after the death of <hi>Iohn, Philip</hi> shewed very manifestly that that same in very deed should haue befalne us, like as he at <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chlen</hi> by the Lord of <hi>Selles</hi> certified and gaue them to understand, that he would break the lawes of the peace, and that he no longer would be bound to keepe them But I pray you for what occasion? was it for neglecting the Romish Religion? Assuredly it had never been more used nor reverenced with the like devotion, care, and diligence, nor never was the zeale of our people so greatly affected thereunto as then. The Bishops of the Churches were then recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved; the Schooles and Colleges were partly instituted, partly renew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and augmented. Finally, there was not any thing omitted that served for the maintaining of the customes and ceremonies of the Romish Church. So that our Netherland might wel haue compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, matched and stroven with Italy and with Rome the chiefe seat and Metropolitane of that Religion. The which the Popes <hi>Nuncius,</hi> (or spirituall Embassadour) who in his behalfe was sent unto us, shal not deny the same. For he writing himselfe unto the Pope concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning this, sayth, that he did much admire, and was therefore excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding joyfull, that those prescriptions and duties (or services) of the Romish Church, were exceeding well maintained by the Nether<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>landers in great devotion and pietie.</p>
                  <p>How and after what manner the affections, wils, and devotions of all our States, and of all the Netherlanders were affected to the king, I need not to make repetition; neither is it needful to proue, that they delighted or loved any thing so much as to fulfil the kings
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:177745:40"/> commands, and to shew obedience thereunto. The Trophaes, Py<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ramedes and Pageants which were made and prepared so sumptuous and costly to the honor, and at the entrance of <hi>Iohn,</hi> can testifie this. How did all the Nobles with such exceeding joy, wishing him good luck, receiue him? How did all the people with great mirth and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joycings receiue him? What bankets and sumptuous feasts at the lands charge, were then with much delight made for joy thereof, that this peace was made and concluded? And what great triumphs all the Netherlanders made and demonstrated upon all their Thea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters when this peace was made, is yet testified by all the inhabiting strangers, who were thereat exceedingly droven to admiration, yea were even astonished.</p>
                  <p>It was no otherwise then, but as if the Netherlanders had then found the beginning and principles of a wel-governed Common-wealth in the person of this their Chiefe, or Governor. Yea, thou thy selfe <hi>Iohn,</hi> if thou wilt but enter into thine owne heart and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science, shalt not be able to deny the same, That the Netherlanders did fully keep and obserue all the contracts and conditions of the peace, which they were bound to keep; and never denied obedience unto the commandement of the king, if they were not more vile then the commandements of <hi>Manlius,</hi> if they did not too too much oppugne the lawes and priviledges.</p>
                  <p>But to the end that I may produce one instance which farre ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds all mens admiration; and which shall perfect this our disputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: you must for a certaintie acknowledge, that the states had un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaken with force of Armes to haue forced the <hi>Hollanders</hi> and <hi>Zealanders</hi> to haue done those things which you most desired, which was the induct on, and as it were the ground-work of your accusations and complaints, if in case they by right, reason, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference, could not be brought thereunto: which things you altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther scorned and rejected, and to the end that this one pretext, this onely pretence might remaine for matter for your false accusations; And that this might be a just occasion for your conjurations: yet this occasion was not sufficient thereunto, neither could it be suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient enough, in regard the same is manifestly known unto all men, not onely to Netherlanders, but also to all strangers, who either saw the whole businesse as it was carried, or else haue heard the same re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reported.
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:177745:40"/> That the <hi>Hollanders</hi> and <hi>Zealanders</hi> haue alwayes entertai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, received, and accomplished the precepts and commandements of the King, no otherwise then if they had been the Oracles or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandements of God: That they never were carelesse nor negligent in their offices or duties which by the law of Nature they were ow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to their Prince. Yet this I wil freely confesse, (which I will at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute and consecrate to their immortal and most high commenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions) that the <hi>Hollanders</hi> and <hi>Zealanders</hi> were the first counsellors, and shewed the way first to the other Provinces, to free and to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine the common liberty. For I wil at the last, <hi>O you most provident men, you most mightie States of Holland and Zealand,</hi> convert and turn my speech and oration from those wicked and horrible dealings of that dishonorable man; to your vertues, valours, and abilities. Should I so sleightly passe by the worthinesse and valiant deeds, and manly courage, whereof every mans mouth is full: and for which every one so highly commendeth, loveth, and honoreth you for.</p>
                  <p>You haue evermore with a valiant, constant and persevering cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage, resisted and rejected that most intolerable and most cruel servi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude and thraldome of the Inquisition, or Faith-presse. And if they now say, that the authoritie, respect and commandement of the King consisted therein; and that you in respect thereof, would not giue way, nor be obedient unto the same; wherein indeed consisteth your glory, and whereof you may justly boast; Yet you confesse, to your great commendation, that you haue given these occasions unto the accusations of <hi>Don Iohn:</hi> That you, being free from all faults, yet in this you are and will be faultie. And herein you may boast, That you with an especiall providence and wisedome, haue careful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly watched and kept your selues, so that at no time, neither by any of these, nor any other Spanish trecheries, perjuries, tricks, or traps, you haue been cousoned, debaucht, nor insnared: that you were the first which were inflamed with a singular constancie and courage, to deliver the Reipublick from the grievous yoke of tyranny and cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ell government. That you with the toarch of your libertie, haue been a light to enlighten all the other Provinces. And that you had farre rather, by these long-during warres, be spent, dye, and indure all kinds of miserie and adversitie: then to forsake your customes, lawes and privileges. I beseech the Lord God, by whose onely con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct,
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:177745:41"/> grace and assistance, you haue atchieved such admirable things, that you may prosperously continue &amp; persevere therin from hence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forth perpetually. Now wil I turne me againe unto that from which I haue digressed, and recommend unto your judgment and arbittre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, O Christian Princes, all what I haue spoken of the deeds of <hi>Don Iohn.</hi> Take notice, iudge, and speak what you think thereof. Considering that of all the States parts, there is nothing omitted, which by the law and contract they had promised to doe: and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarily for <hi>Don Iohns</hi> part, of the ten parts of the agreement or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position, which wholly he ought to haue performed, he hath not discharged any one poynt thereof wel nor honestly as hee ought. And hereby you may see, with what justice and equitie we undertook this businesse, and how we (having undertaken the same) haue dealt and proceeded therein.</p>
                  <p>For when the States perceived, that all their hope and trust for the cashiering of those great numbers of the Germane souldiers was fru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate, and that they were laid in the cities, townes, and mouthes of the frontier garrisons, and that they kept <hi>Namen</hi> &amp; <hi>Charlemont,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Cities and Castles that were very well provided; to the end that <hi>Don Iohn</hi> that way, might receiue and bring into the Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therlands that great armie which hee had desired of the King in his letters; and moreover they perceiving that the hate and envy of all the souldiers was turned upon them, and that they with an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding greedy desire longed for the pilaging of the greatest Cities, And that they attended onely but for the least signe and token of their Prince, to haue falne ravenously and furiously, as raging beasts, and to haue ceized upon the liues, goods, and meanes of the Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therlanders. That <hi>Don Iohn</hi> himselfe, and other naughtie people daily threatned the ruine and subversion of our natiue countrey. That they by the demonstrations, hand-writings, mouthes and letters of their confederats, were themselues convinced. That they all had a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greed to set the cities and towns on fire, and to haue slain al the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles and chiefe of the Citizens, to haue destroyed the Netherlands, and to haue rooted out the Reipublick. Who is he then that would not be awaked and stirred up for the defence and preservation of the common good? Who is he that with good counsel would not prevent the trecheries of <hi>Iohn?</hi> Who would be so unprovident, and
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:177745:41"/> such a coward, that would not defend and maintaine his owne life with weapons and warre? Assuredly reason hath taught the learned; necessitie the Barbarians; custome the heathens; and nature it selfe the unreasonable beasts, to repel violence with violence, even to their uttermost abilitie.</p>
                  <p>You your selues, O great and gracious Princes, which possesse kingdomes freely and in prosperitie; may easily know and under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand this; and know also that even so it must be done. But what do I say, that you must know it? All the Spaniards our enemies do know it, and will freely confesse the same. For they demonstrate it in their deeds, that the same hath been just, and is so yet. For considering that <hi>Henricus Castellanus</hi> (being a bastard) and the great Grand-fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of King <hi>Philip,</hi> did expel <hi>Peter</hi> his lawfull brother and right heire, out of the kingdome, because he seemed to use tyrannical dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling: and because he seemed to dominicre contrary to the lawes and customes of his kingdome; And, that King <hi>Philip</hi> upon the same conditions that he inherited Spaine, did inherit the Netherlands, (viz. that he should maintaine and religiously obserue the lawes and customes.) Wherefore then may not we, as the Spaniards did reject <hi>Peter,</hi> even as wel reject <hi>Philip</hi> (who oppresseth his subjects with an unjust and unlawful government) and expel him with our armes for ever out of our Provinces.</p>
                  <p>But I feare, O Princes, that I haue too much abused your patience, and that my oration seemeth to haue run such a course, that I need not adde any thing more thereunto. Yet I intreat your leaue, that you be pleased to suffer me, though very briefly to continue in that which <hi>Philip</hi> sought to effect after the government of <hi>Iohn,</hi> by the deceit of an hypocritical and dissembled peace; to the end that you may clearly see and perceiue, wherfore that we, so long as the world stands, may never make any peace with <hi>Philip,</hi> but now and for ever without ceasing, are bound to warre against him. The very name of peace (I confesse) is exceeding sweet, a peace that is good &amp; sound: But between peace and that bondage which is cloaked, covered, and falsly folded up in a concealed peace, is indeed a very great diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence. Peace is a stil and quiet libertie: but that bondage, or all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of feare thereof, is the extreame of all evils and mischieues. Such was the peace, (if a man may call that peace) which induced, or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:177745:42"/> seduced the Netherlanders even unto <hi>Collen.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>When as the States by their Embassadours and letters unto you and your predecessors, <hi>O all you Princes of Christendome,</hi> had againe intreated; that you by your authorities, respect, and exhortations, should ratifie, establish, confirme, and look unto that peace which <hi>Philip</hi> after a new cousening manner should make, that the same should not be deceitful: Like as he certainely and most maliciously by his deceit over-threw the same. For the Spaniards then made no delay, but presently brought in new dissentions into <hi>Artois</hi> and <hi>Henegowe,</hi> causing them to fall away from the other Provinces, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the which they even unto this present haue dominiered. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards by force of Armes, violently they surprised <hi>Mastricht,</hi> and moreover and aboue they, partly by violence, and partly by great promises, haue sought to get into their power many other cities and provinces.</p>
                  <p>And finally is that <hi>Vlisses</hi>-like-wit <hi>Alexander Farnesius</hi> Duke of <hi>Parma,</hi> brought out of <hi>Italie,</hi> who like unto a most craftie and cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning bird-catcher, with the song of his len<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>tie, and promises of great rewards, insnared and captivated all the Cities and Townes of Bra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bant and Flaunders.</p>
                  <p>Of this Prince I could say very much, which I am constrained to omit: Yet this one matter I cannot passe by in silence; That, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though in the time of his government he effected many things very great and eminent for <hi>Philip,</hi> yet could hee not escape of being suspected, as if hee would haue undermined the King in the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, because that through his gentlenesse, lenitie and ami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie; he had drawne unto him the affections of all the Netherlan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, and that he also seemed perspicuously to haue looked into, and also to beare a hatred to the wickednesse and fraudulent trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheries and deceites of the Spaniards. Therefore <hi>Philip</hi> gaue him <hi>fungos,</hi> or Toads-bread to eate, which <hi>Agrippina</hi> had so commended to the Emperour, to the end that by the power and operation thereof, he might be admitted, counted and received into the number of the gods.</p>
                  <p>But I pray you, what was that at last for a peace, which as a Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>met or bright shining starre, shined unto us out of the firmament of the Spanish trecheries unto which the Duke of <hi>Parma</hi> counselled
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:177745:42"/> us, at what time the Arch-enemy stood, as it were, over our heads, and that the incredible great Spanish Fleet filled and covered the great Ocean or main Sea? A Fleet which was so terrible to behold, that I can hardly judge, whether the Fleet that <hi>Xerxes</hi> had, which covered the Sea called <hi>Mare Ponticum</hi> had a greater number of Shippes, more Souldiers, or greater warlike preparation. With this Fleet <hi>Phillip</hi> had thought totally to haue suppressed us: who were at that time ravished, as it were, with that pleasant and delightful sound of peace. Yet when this Fleet, by the onely power of the Almighty God, was wonderfully destroyed and brought to naught; then presently by the Emperours Embassa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dours he offered these Provinces a new Treatie of Peace, to the end, that he therby might transport all his Army and power of warre out of the <hi>Netherlands</hi> into <hi>France.</hi> The treacheries which many yeares before he had plotted against that Kingdom, beganne then to haue a wonderful good progression: For his natural kins<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man <hi>Henry</hi> being made away by paracide, (or his murthering of a kinsman,) and the state of all that kingdome, being utterly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fused with Civill warre; then the matter, and the present occasion required, that he with Armes and a mighty Hoast, should pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secute his designe, in that flourishing and famous great Kingdom of <hi>France,</hi> which Kingdom he by violence having taken in and conquered, he might therafter, without any trouble at all, haue subjugated those Netherlandish Provinces, and all the other King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes of Christendom.</p>
                  <p>What? Is it yet lawful for me, or may I yet speak any more of Arrereges, or residue of the dangers of this Reipublick? Yes, it is lawful for me, and it shal be lawful for me alwaies to stand for the dignity of my natiue Country, and to confesse the truth. Like as al good Orators, or eloquent speakers, doe ever keep some of their most forcible and ponderous Arguments to the last. And like as ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perienced Generals use to place their best souldiers in the last rankes; even so <hi>Phillip</hi> in these latter yeares presented a peace unto these <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therlands,</hi> which should be adorned and confirmed with notable fidelity; the whole foundation and chiefe ground work therof, lay and consisted in the vertues, mercy, endevours, diligence, and in the loue of the Arch-duke <hi>Ernestus</hi> his sisters sonne; who, after the
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:177745:43"/> Duke of <hi>Parma,</hi> was placed in the government of these Provinces: He promised these Provinces a peace; not such a peace as should be limited with any grievous or heavy conditions and contracts, like as the former was; but such a peace as they themselues would wish or desire. In the mean time <hi>Phillip</hi> sent his great and huge Armies into <hi>France,</hi> and his secret murtherers into <hi>Holland,</hi> to haue murthered the Illustrious Prince <hi>Mauritts,</hi> Earle of <hi>Nassow,</hi> a famous and nota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble imitator of the vertues and valour of his father, and a singular defender of our Liberty; and by such an odious and trecherous villainy, to haue made him away; like as they, but a little before, by a most cruel and trecherous hand, had murthered his most worthy and valiant father, the Prince of <hi>Orange.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And finally <hi>Phillip</hi> concluded many more mischievous, and more wicked purposes against these Provinces, then ever before he could haue bethought himselfe of. I doe not speak any thing unadvisedly, <hi>ô Princes,</hi> but that which thousands besides me of good reputati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, can restifie in faith and verity, and that which <hi>Phillips</hi> own let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters doe make good.</p>
                  <p>What then? Meaneth the king of <hi>Spain,</hi> that our States by any propositions of peace, can be diverted from their enterprises and designments? Doth he not yet know and understand, that all our affections are so obdurate and hardned, that we wil far rather yeeld and giue place to Armes and Warre, then to any kind of new inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted peace-treacheries, after what manner soever the same might be propounded? Or, thinketh he peradventure, that the affections of our States every day, lye open to his desire and appetite? What? Is he yet ignorant, that the counsels of all our people, with a general consent and uniformity of voices, are long agoe united and knit fast together in this point; and that they wil farre rather honourably in warre and Armes liue and die, for their Lawes, and for their na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue Country; then from henceforth shamefully to sinke or quaile, under his treacheries and deceits? What, doe I say sinke or quaile? Nay, to come into the extremest evils of Tyrannie; to be bound with untolerable and inhumane bonds of slavery, and to be recko<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned and accounted among those slaues that are bought and sold. We haue prepared, made ready and sharpened, a perpetual and an everlasting warre and Armes against him: we neither haue, nor may
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:177745:43"/> cast our eies upon any other peace, then upon such a peace as is grounded, confirmed, and may be maintained with force and Armes.</p>
                  <p>But in regard that a little before I beganne to speak of <hi>France,</hi> and to proue that our warre partly was joyned with that same; ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I will proceed to adde some other matters hereunto, by the which you may evidently see and perceiue, how many treacheries, traps and deceits that <hi>Phillip</hi> hath laid for them.</p>
                  <p>He hath a long time since, as you know, <hi>ô Princes,</hi> laboured and endevoured to assail <hi>France,</hi> with all the violence and force of his warre; to the end that he by the occasion of the Civil dissentions in <hi>France,</hi> might effect so much by his warres and charges: that if he could not swallow and devoure the whole Kingdom; yet that at the least he might get a great part therof. For he had made his ful reckoning and account beforehand, by preparing of that cruel Fleet, that both <hi>France</hi> and <hi>England</hi> had been a prey unto their ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies: Wheras those good Princes, notwithstanding had nothing at all endamaged him, neither was he by any injustice provoked to that warre: unlesse peradventure it be, that he thought this occasion sufficient; that the Pope, at the wil and desire of <hi>Phillip</hi> had ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communicated those two flourishing Kingdoms, for their exercising and ministery of the Reformed Religion; who for the extirpation and eradication of that Religion; <hi>Phillip</hi> as a <hi>Cato major,</hi> with the puissance of the Romish Censores (or correction masters) useth to haue regard unto all the Kings and people of the earth, and therfore to correct and punish them, which is indeed a matter known unto you all; for which no man can sufficiently wonder at the shamefulnesse thereof, and might now neither be passed by nor omitted. And that <hi>Phillip</hi> in these warres of France dealt most ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nestly, and with the greatest diligence and alacrity, with the Duke of <hi>Feres,</hi> and other Spaniards of the League, whom he as compani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, had assisted in that warre, to haue estranged the Right and Title of the Crown of <hi>France,</hi> not onely from the succession or descent of the Kings bloud and kinred, but even from all Frenchmen, and to haue drawn the same to <hi>Spain.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>These things are so certain, <hi>ô Princes,</hi> that there is no man which doubteth of the truth hereof. But to what end doe I bring these
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:177745:44"/> into your Remembrances; What is this to maintain the purpose I haue in hand; For this end it serveth; therby to proue how exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing great the ambition is of this most cruel Tyrant; and to the end you may perceiue and see how greatly, not onely we, but even all of you together, must keep good watch and look unto it. For like as the nature of the Vine, is to extend the branches, as the armes therof farre and wide, and therwith embraceth and layeth hold upon every thing that is neer it, if it be not lopt and pruned: Even so shal <hi>Phillip,</hi> if you doe not all at once make resistance, at the last destroy and devoure all Christendom, with most cruel and blou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy warre.</p>
                  <p>Moreover, he by his Bribery, and secret conspiracy had lately effected so much in <hi>Scotland,</hi> that some of the chiefe of that King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, should haue received and taken in twenty thousand Spaniards, if they had not been punished (after the matter was known and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed) according as their treason deserved. I need not to think with my selfe, that I can sufficiently expresse with words, what trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, what perils, what dangers, he, so oftentimes hath attempted against the Queen and Kingdom of <hi>England.</hi> Can ambition and violence proceed yet any further? Yes truely. For the like trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheries practised he a little before against the Principallity of <hi>Collen,</hi> the Dukedomes of <hi>Gelders, Gulich, Cleaue;</hi> the County of <hi>Berghe,</hi> and that ancient Emperial Town of <hi>Aken:</hi> All which is most mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>festly and apparantly known by good Testimonie, and by his own letters. And who knoweth in what lurking hole and corner of hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrisie and dissimulation, he hideth and sheltreth his most mortal hate against the most mighty Princes of <hi>Italy;</hi> whom (as soon as the wind of the first oportunity shal blow) very suddenly, shal be turned into coales and ashes, by his unquenchable and fearful great flames of warre.</p>
                  <p>Doe ye not yet see and perceiue enough, <hi>ô Princes,</hi> what treache<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries and deceits that <hi>Phillip</hi> prepareth, for your most happy King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes and Provinces, which are your patrimony? Considering there is no man so blind nor senselesse, who seeth not; and under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standeth not that the ambition of <hi>Phillip</hi> never resteth, but daily draweth him from land to land, and raiseth a new warre out of war; So that he by warres, sinne, mischiefe, and meer villanous deceits
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:177745:44"/> and treacheries, under the pretence of a seeming-peace, seeketh to deject and detrude every one of you from the seat of your Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. For this his desire is unsatiable and immoderate, and cannot be included nor shut up, neither in Heaven nor in Earth. If that all <hi>Phillips</hi> Kingdoms which he useth commonly in that long train or taile of his most proud Titles and Termes of honour were put or laid into one of the Scales of <hi>Critolaes</hi> ballance, and in the other scoale his Ambition or greedy desire of Honour; all his Kingdome would scarcely weigh the quantity of one grain, in comparison of his Ambition.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Alexander</hi> the Great looked about for more worlds, when he had conquered the whole world; but <hi>Philip</hi> would, if he could, with the Gyants assault the heavens. And therefore, <hi>ô Princes,</hi> and you <hi>most peaceful Princes,</hi> I intreat you, and I would admonish you, that you judge no more of the occasion and lawfulnesse of our warre; but in your judgments and opinions to hold it for good: and I exhort you most earnestly again and againe, that you by all meanes, both in your understandings, and with all your powers, wil take heed of the treacheries, robberies, and mischievous practises of <hi>Phillips</hi> deceits.</p>
                  <p>In former times, when as the <hi>Athenians,</hi> partly with warre, and partly with deceits and treacheries, sought to get unto themselues certain neer adjacent places, as the Cities of <hi>Syracusa, Lacedemon, Messena</hi> and <hi>Catina:</hi> they by their immoderate Ambition, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire of others Rights, drew such an hatred upon their own heads, that <hi>Darius</hi> the most mighty King of <hi>Persia,</hi> with the whole Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try of <hi>Grecia,</hi> voluntarily undertook and prosecuted warre against them, unto which every man ran and hasted, as to quench a pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick flame. But you, <hi>ô most illustrious Princes,</hi> ought long agoe to haue expelled <hi>Phillip</hi> (with your conjoyned forces from you, and from your prosperous States) that seeketh continually your liues and Kingdoms, by most unjust warre, and by most wicked enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prises.</p>
                  <p>And it concernes, and is fitting, not onely for you, who for a long time since, haue been provoked, spurred, and stirred up ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto, by the many injuries and ambition of <hi>Phillip,</hi> but even you altogether, who see and perceiue, that he incroacheth with violence
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:177745:45"/> upon the limits of your neighbours; and with an easie and slow pace creepeth and incroacheth towards your Countries. It stand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth you upon in time to look unto it; to the end, that your neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring Countries, being conquered and brought under his slave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry and bondage; Tyrannie, when you least think upon it, doe not incroach upon you.</p>
                  <p>When as <hi>Phillip</hi> of <hi>Macedon,</hi> the father of <hi>Alexander</hi> the Great, after the battel with the <hi>Tribaldes,</hi> had entertained a long dissembling warre against the <hi>Athenians,</hi> the <hi>Thebeans</hi> assembled themselues for this occasion; fearing, lest when the <hi>Athenians</hi> had been conquered, the fire of their neighbouring-warre might haue flown unto them. And a little before, there being a confederacie made betwixt two of the mightiest Cities; who, before had been at extreme enmity with each other, terrified therby, and by their Embassadours, all the Country of <hi>Grecia:</hi> esteeming it so, that a common enemy ought and must be repelled with common force; so that if the first inva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of <hi>Phillip</hi> of <hi>Macedon,</hi> had had good succcsse; he would not haue held up, nor rested until he had conquered and subjugated the whole country of <hi>Grecia.</hi> The <hi>Romanes</hi> in former time, perceiving that the power of the <hi>Carthaginians</hi> increased and grew great, they had an especial care that the <hi>Carthagenians</hi> should not grow so great as to over-master them: And for that end they sent their souldiers to relieue the <hi>Mamertines</hi> from the beleagring, and to relieue <hi>Spain</hi> from the servitude of the <hi>Africanes.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Although that the <hi>Venetians</hi> are not very lightly incited to warre, but when the matter of necessity constrayneth them: Yet they never refused to send their warlike power for the succour of others that were under them, when they perceived that their neighbours con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended with each other, with an unreasonable and an immoderate-violent ambition.</p>
                  <p>These, and the like, even to an innumerable examples (or fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deeds) doe teach you, how carefully you must take heed of that most pestilent evil, of the Spanish ambition; and doe shew; or proue, that it is a righteous and just cause, that even all of you with one consent with us, prosecute a warre against that Tyrant.</p>
                  <p>For our States doe know, that the occasion of their warre against <hi>Phillip,</hi> is not onely exceeding just and righteous, and ever was:
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:177745:45"/> but also, that they at no time, now nor never, may cease their warre, that they may make no peace with <hi>Phillip,</hi> but alwaies must maintain warre against that Tyrant. For we are taught by our friends, how we must take heed of our enemies: For if <hi>Phillip</hi> doe gape and long so earnestly, and with such diligence for your Kingdomes; like as you see he daily doth: how then shal we speed? For assured<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>y he wil never lay aside Armes before that he hath subjugated all the <hi>Nether<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lands</hi> under him, because it is a Countrey so fit for his purpose; who, out of them may attempt many enterprises upon your King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms, and daily may beginne to raise new warres against you, and draw out of them Souldiers, Armes, and all manner of warlike pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vision against your adjacent Countries. And therfore he would farre rather cast the greatest part of Christendome for a prey to the <hi>Turks;</hi> then to cease these warres.</p>
                  <p>At the last Parlement in <hi>Germany,</hi> he would not consent to fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish the Emperor with any souldiers, nor assistance against the <hi>Turke;</hi> and the reason was, because he might the better vex Christendom with warre.</p>
                  <p>Doe ye yet doubt of this, <hi>ô yee Princes,</hi> which you your selues haue seen, that <hi>Phillip</hi> in the beginning of our Civil Commotions, had far rather loost two Kingdoms, <hi>Tunis</hi> and <hi>Goulet,</hi> which the <hi>Turkes,</hi> under their General <hi>Sinam Bascha,</hi> then recovered from him, then that he would for a while cease his warres with us; or would remoue his Souldiers out of these Provinces, against the most deadly and mortal enemy of all Christendome.</p>
                  <p>And you know how many Souldiers, how much Armes, and what charges <hi>Phillip</hi> hath been at, and wasted, to maintain this warre against us: So that if you would but reckon up the same, you shal find that he might haue bought and purchased two <hi>Netherlands</hi> with that money: although notwithstanding they be very great, rich, and exceeding copious. So that there is no doubt of this, but <hi>Phillip</hi> would far rather endure the greatest losse that might betyde him then that he would leaue <hi>Belgium</hi> without <hi>bellum,</hi> or the Low-countries without long-encountrings of warre, without strife, without soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers, that they might liue in peace and quietnesse, freely and whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly according to their Lawes and Priviledges. For by this war, and with the conquest of our Provinces, he wil lay and establish the stron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gest
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:177745:46"/> foundation and surest ground-work of his Monarchy, Sole-dominion, Tyrannie, and cruel Government. For when he saw and perceived that these Countries were so singularly fitting for his cruel treacheries and designments, and that our Lawes and Liberties con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarily did wholy oppose the same: therfore sought he first of all with warre, with force and violence, to pluck up, teare in sunder, and with violence to oppresse the same, to the end, that his subjects of other Kingdoms, which at this present he hath subjugated, or else might subjugate hereafter; from this our concording, and ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral defence of our Lawes and Liberty, might take no example or instance, with the greater courage and alacrity to stand for, and main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain their liberty.</p>
                  <p>What doe you then judge, <hi>ô you most peaceful Princes?</hi> Or, what is your conclusion that our States ought to doe, who chiefly seek for the common good of their natiue Countrey? Verely it cannot be with them, as it is under the Government of a cruel Tyrant, and as it usually is in ill-governed Reipublicks: they are not used to be lead, and to submit themselues at any time, with cap and knee, as flatterers doe; to the wills, desires, and lusts of their superiour Lords, nor to be dealt with all as hired slaues? considering that they never would admit nor suffer, that their Lawes, Liberties, nor their Reipublick, should bow or submit under the yoke of unjust and unlawful Government: But haue as good fathers of their natiue-Countrey; as good fighters for their freedom, and Defendors of their Lawes, (like as it must be in a Reipublick which is moderately and civilly governed by their Prince) directed their designes, wils, and government of their super<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>our Lord; according to their Lawes, and the preservation of their Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty.</p>
                  <p>Do you think that the Spaniards shal spoyle and cruelly vexe and torment our Reipublick, and that we with shame wil leaue and quit the same? Shal we neglect our deare countrey and libertie? Must we despise the lawes of our predecessors? And shall they pervert &amp; turn topsie-turvie our civil orders and policie into tyranny? And shal we with wringing hands look upon the coarse, and behold the exequies or funerall of our <hi>patriae</hi> and natiue countrey? Shal they rend &amp; teare in peeces the body of our common-wealth, and like most ravenous
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:177745:46"/> beasts devoure the same? And shal we like slaues, with praying and intreating, hardly preserue our own liues, goods, and meanes? Or do ye not far rather laud and extol with the highest commendation of honor, this wil &amp; affection of our States, for their manumising and preserving of their deare and natiue countrey? incite and exhort you them to proceed as they are best able, and to the uttermost of their powers, for the preservation and manumising of their owne liues &amp; libertie? Come not these things daily into your remembrances, when you think of the Netherlandish warre, or discourse thereof, which I haue now demonstrated, and with sure and infallible and uncontrol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lable reasons proved unto you, viz. that our States, &amp; all the Nether<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, being drenched and soaked in misery, and oppressed with the crueltie of the Spaniards; and being expeld out of their natiue coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey, of mere necessitie were constrained to take Arms against <hi>Philip.</hi> And that now all the other treacheries, infidelities &amp; injuries which the Spaniards during the time of these wars haue done unto the Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therlanders, being so great, so inhumane, and so incredible, that they themselues (so to speak) do earnestly exhort, do require &amp; command, that the States with a constant courage, should keep and maintaine their armes, and neither now, nor never, to lay them out of their hands; but to shew unto the other subjects of <hi>Philip</hi> (those of <hi>Sicilia, Calabria, Lombardie, Arragon, Castile, India</hi> and <hi>Portugal)</hi> yea even un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to your selues, <hi>O illustrious Princes,</hi> I say to shew, &amp; with valiant deeds to proue, that not onely we, but all of you together, yea and all men upon the face of the earth, far rather ought to dye, then to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold or look upon the face of that tyrant.</p>
                  <p>Do ye yet think, or can you imagine with your selues, that <hi>Philip,</hi> with the limits of our countrey, hath limited in his tyranny? Do yee not yet see and perceiue, that the high ascending and mortal flames of the Spanish tyranny, devoureth and swalloweth up the tresholds, doores, and turrets of your kingdomes? Arise and at the last awake out of this your sleepe and carelesnesse; come hither with speed, and in all haste flye hereinto, for to quench these universall fire-flames. Wherefore doe yee seek unto us against our wils, by your counsels, authorities, and respects, to induce us to make peace with <hi>Philip;</hi> whereas it had been more fitting, that you your selues long a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goe, with warre and force of armes should haue expelled <hi>Philip,</hi> and
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:177745:47"/> with an especial force and power to haue supprest him?</p>
                  <p>And to the end I may speak unto you all one after another, you <hi>most mightie Princes of Germanie,</hi> be sencible, that <hi>Philip</hi> in your Dutchland doth not hunt after a cruel and unjust government; but (so to speak) doth possesse the same already. For he having once conquered these Netherlandish provinces; when you will not bow and submit to his government: he will haue all the havens of the sea, and the mouthes of all the Germane rivers at his owne will, and in his owne power; thereby afterwards to impose such grievous tolles and taxations upon your navigation and trading, or else whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly wil hinder the same, even as it shall please himselfe. And this is that for which, and in behalfe whereof, one or two of the provinces doe appeare in your assemblies and consultations: you heare him publickly speak his minde, and you esteeme and preferre his tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nical advice and counsel, before your owne prosperitie and tranqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie. You haue him, the Bishop of <hi>Frisinghen</hi> and <hi>Hildeshem</hi> prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red before; and you haue seene them made Princes and Prince-Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors of the Empire; The Bishop of <hi>Collen, Liege,</hi> and <hi>Magdeborgh:</hi> and you haue seen that the most ambitious Duke of <hi>Bavaria</hi> hath laid snares for you all.</p>
                  <p>And to the end that I may turne my speech unto you, <hi>O you illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strious and mightie powerful Princes of Poland,</hi> hath not <hi>Philip</hi> brought a great number of that generation of mankind, (I <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>To you also, <hi>most peacefull Princes of Italie,</hi> I haue already sayd, and say againe, that the sword of the Spanish tyranny hangeth by a very small threed over your heads, already naked and drawne out of the scabberd.</p>
                  <p>And for you, <hi>O most illustrious Senators (or privie Counsellors) of Ʋenice,</hi> you your selues haue seen and beheld the tyranny of <hi>Philip</hi> in your owne State and government, when he sent money to arme the Turke against you; and diverted the power and force of the Turk from his owne dominions upon <hi>Cypris;</hi> although that he by the equitie and right of the covenant, had been exceedingly oblie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:177745:47"/> and beholding unto you.</p>
                  <p>Therefore <hi>O Princes of Christendome,</hi> yet even now, at the long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>last, be carefull of your owne estates and affaires, of your owne liues and prosperitie; mark and consider it wel, that <hi>Philip</hi> is enemy and tyrant to you all, and suffer him to liue no longer in the world: but resist and impeach his ambition to reigne; and that his pestilent and mortal government proceed no further. And like as some certaine members are cut off when they begin to be without life and bloud, and are hurtful to all the other parts of the body; even so must you also esteeme, that this inhumane cruelty in humane shape, must (so to speak) be separated and cut from the common body of men. Verily the deed of the Persians is much to be commended, and ought to be wel thought upon of you all; who when <hi>Cometes</hi> and <hi>Oropastes,</hi> two of their Magicians (or wise men) by the like tyrannie and mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of <hi>Smerdis,</hi> king of Persia, possessed the kingdome: they were slaine by the valour of seven of the ablest Princes of Persia, all of them running with a singular affection, diligence, and burning zeale to kill and to destroy those tyrants with their swords, one of the Magitians clasped about the neck of one of the Princes whose name was <hi>Gobrias,</hi> which made his companions to linger the more, because they would not kill him in steed of the magician (for this was done in a dark place) who commanded the Magician to thrust his sword through his body. Yet in the end the Magician was slaine, and this valiant <hi>Gobrias</hi> (who had rather to haue died, then that the tyrant should haue escaped with life) was saved, and had his life preserved. Such an hate did these men beare to tyrants.</p>
                  <p>The Grecians in former times attributed divine honour to those men who had slaine a tyrant. And doe you thinke that the Nether<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>landers shal doe evil, or more unjust, that they oppose and resist <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lip</hi> that inhumane tyrant.</p>
                  <p>The Romanes expelled their king <hi>Tarquinus Superbus,</hi> because that he, did but in some sort weaken the state of their common-wealth; and shal we suffer or indure <hi>Philip</hi> in our common-wealth, who not onely with fire and sword would destroy and turn up-side-downe all the Netherlands, but even the whole world? No, by no meanes. Our States without doubt, wil proceed and prepare the way for you to break off, and to expel this tyrant. They wil persevere
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:177745:48"/> to divert, driue away, and to soile him so farre and wide from suppressing and killing of our prosperitie, that once, not onely they and theirs, but also even the other provinces of the Netherlands, may be re-established in their former libertie, and may lead them out of the straights of the Spanish tyrannie, and repossesse them in the possession of their predecessors. That finally, they being re-establi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed, and better ordered, and united and bound with the Provinces of the whole Netherlands; they may stop the incursion and invasion of this cruel tyrant, and altogether with one accord may expel him from their prosperitie, and from their common libertie. <hi>Amen.</hi>

But before I come to what I intend, I haue thought fit having some oversight in the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lishing of this Treatise aforegoing, to note by the way, the ill tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>slating of one word, in the 21 folio, it is touching the Princesse of <hi>Parma,</hi> the Translator termes her <hi>a crafty Queane,</hi> wheras the word beares no such sence in the Dutch, but signifies one that hath a sharp wit to deceiue, as is said of the serpent that beguiled <hi>Eue.</hi> Beside, that <note place="margin">The Dutch word <hi>Ghe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sante</hi> signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fieth indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rently Embas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sadour or Messenger.</note> that is translated <hi>Embassadour,</hi> speaking of such as were sent from the States to the King, I conceiue to be more fittingly rendred <hi>Messenger.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>First, thou art to understand, gentle Reader, that the King of <hi>Spain</hi> was lovingly received here in the 17 Provinces, and a solemn oath was taken on both parts; the King for his part swore to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain all their Lawes and Priviledges, and they to him all due homage and allegance: He presently demanded of them a summe of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny. wherupon the States did assemble, and collected for him 40
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:177745:50"/> millions of Florines, of <hi>Brabants</hi> mony, to be paid in nine years, and they paid <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>t into his Exchequer; and although it was more then they had paid before to his predecessours, yet upon this he did take great displeasure against them; and, as they write, he for this did hate them to death.</p>
                  <p>But he pretended this to be the cause of his wroth, because he saw that there were some among them, that did defie the Pope and all his Religion: but that could not be, for the Citie of <hi>Aelst</hi> was as superstitious in that Religion as <hi>Rome</hi> it selfe; for they did perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure the Reformed Religion even unto death: and yet for all that both they, and 170 far villages that belonged unto them, were by them plundered and spoyled of all their goods, and many of them wounded and tormented for to confesse where their mony was, and many were killed. Thus much by the way.</p>
                  <p>My scope and chiefe intent, is to shew the first and just cause of the warres in the <hi>Netherlands;</hi> wherby the diligent Reader (not parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally affected) may clearly understand, that the <hi>Netherlanders</hi> did not rebelliously take up Armes against a lawful Prince, (as some ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norantly thinke and speake) but justly and religiously defend them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues against a perfidious Tyrant who sought their ruine, by all pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible meanes he could, and the subversion of the whole State. A long while they patiently underwent his cruel oppressions, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tolierable vexations, as the Histories clearly manifest; til there was no hope, but either they must become slaues in soule and body, worse then that of <hi>Israel</hi> in <hi>Egypt,</hi> they and theirs for ever, or else be butchered by mercilesse executioners of a cruel Tyrant. This Tyrant having a purpose to innovate all things, to root out the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient inhabitants, and to frustrate all the Lawes, Customes and Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledges which himselfe had sworn to maintain, knew not how bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to effect his evil ends, then by raysing a bloudy Inquisition to set over them for their government; which said Inquisition (raised <note place="margin">The inquisiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on was there 4. yeares be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore.</note> in <hi>Spain)</hi> concluded and pronounced certain Articles, the tenth of February 1568, which were confirmed by the King, the 26 fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing. Now because it may appear I doe them no wrong in this charge, I wil lay down the Articles themselues verbatim.</p>
                  <p>The most sacred Office of Inquisition so often attempted in the Netherlands by his Majestie, and hindered untill this time, shall bee
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:177745:50"/> instituted and advanced in this manner, which is most expedient.</p>
                  <p n="1">1 They must perswade the Emperour, being gone astray, and wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kedly confederated with heretickes, that hee resigne his kingdomes unto his Sonne, with the whole administration of the Nether<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lands.</p>
                  <p n="2">2 That the Emperour with his two sisters, having given over all affaires, leaving the Netherlands, shall retire into Spaine unto Vs, being assured that they shall never returne more to doe any harme.</p>
                  <p n="3">3 These being dispatcht, we must also draw the king to us, &amp; keep him for ever that he part not, and not suffer any Flemmings to haue accesse or conference with him.</p>
                  <p n="4">4 That the King write unto, and command the Clergie of the Netherlands, that with the Inquisition they should accept of 15 new Bishops, the which should be free from all secular jurisdiction, yea in cases of treason.</p>
                  <p n="5">5 The subjects of the Netherlands through their malice &amp; way<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardnesse, will revolt and moue seditions and tumults, pleasing to all but to our companie.</p>
                  <p n="6">6 The Princes and Noblemen, heads and authouts of those fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, with the subjects, must be taken away, and the others reduced unto reason.</p>
                  <p n="7">7 They shall hire at our charge theeues and spoilers of Churches and Images, whose offences shall be by all the world imputed to Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bels, by some subtill meanes, and so we shall vanquish them.</p>
                  <p n="8">8 That all Comerce, Negotiation, Liberties, and Privileges, shall be rooted out, and that all be reduced to extreame povertie, whereby the realme shall be permanent for Vs.</p>
                  <p n="9">9 No man of all those Countries (except he be of our faction) shall be held worthy to liue; and finally all to be rooted out: and all Goods, Possessions, Arts, and Trades, and all Orders to bee taken away, untill there may bee a new Realme, and a new people.</p>
                  <p n="10">10 In this action the wise and valiant Duke <hi>Alva</hi> shal be imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in person; whereas any other, were he of the blood Royall, or a Prince, shall be of no esteeme: so as being suspect, yea in the smal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lest matters, they must be dispatcht.</p>
                  <p n="11">
                     <pb n="4" facs="tcp:177745:51"/>11 No Contracts, Rights, Promises, Donations, Oathes, Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leges, and solemne Assertions of the Netherlands, shall bee of any force for the inhabitants, as being guiltie of high treason.</p>
                  <p n="12">12 But aboue al we must haue an especial care that in these matters of so great weight and moment, wee proceed not violently, but by meanes, by degrees, and that discreetly, to the end the Princes, No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilitie, and inferiour subjects may mutinie amongst themselues, so that one may persecute, yea execute the other until at last the hang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man be executed himselfe. For in all Christendome is there not a Nation more foolish and indiscreet, and whose levitie and incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stancie may sooner be deceived then these Netherlanders, and God punisheth them accordingly.</p>
                  <p>There were other Articles found in President <hi>Vergaes</hi> chamber at <hi>Antwerpe,</hi> and there Printed; and those are more cruel then these.</p>
                  <p>By these articles and unlimited power of these lawlesse Inquisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors, no man had any assurance of life or goods for a day, but were in danger continually to be called into question, either for the law of their God, or for some work of mercie, which either religion, mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral equitie, or the bond of nature called for: or else if they had co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour for none of these, they would impose such unreasonable taxa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, which if the Cormorants had not their gorges crambed full, they would make prey of all, whether by right or wrong it mattered not. But my purpose being to avoyd prolixitie, and to passe by im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>rtinencies and needlesse repetitions, I wil come to that I inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded. In the yeare 1565 a match was concluded for the Prince of <hi>Parma,</hi> and the nuptials were solemnized at <hi>Bruxels,</hi> whither all the Nobilitie and Gentry of the countrey were invited, and according<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly there met of them about foure hundred, who like faithfull <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses</hi> being grieved to see the daily oppression of their brethren by the hard task-masters of the Inquisition, who not onely robbed them of their goods, but also by inhumane cruelty, and unnaturall butchery, deprived them of their liues, who daily led them as sheepe unto the slaughter: The consideration hereof they joyntly layd to heart, and hereupon (being met upon this occasion) they resolved to present al petition to the Princesse of <hi>Parma,</hi> which they did the 5 of April
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:177745:51"/> next following. The Earle of Breedrod delivering the petition, humbly requested a favourable answer. Three dayes after they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived this answer, viz. they should send two of their Noblemen to the king, by whom she would write in their behalfe. The Lord of Barlaymont being present, after their departure sayd <hi>(like a flattering Courtier)</hi> they were a company of Rascals and Beggars.</p>
                  <p>It was concluded that the Marquesse of Bargen, and the Lord of Mountigny should goe into Spain, who humbly presented their suite to the King, but could get no answer in 16 monthes after.</p>
                  <p>The 26 of August <hi>anno</hi> 1566, the Princesse of <hi>Parma</hi> sent for the Gentrie, telling them she had received letters from the King, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining promise that all should be well, and that the Inquisition should cease. And for the Proclamations they should not be of force, but his Majestie would take such order as they and the State should wel like of. The Princesse also gaue them toleration for their Religion, on condition they should not deface, nor break downe the ornaments of the Churches: for, there had been before this time vilde and lewd persons that frequented the meetings of the Reformed; these went into the Papists Churches, stole their silver and what was worth carrying away, and brake down their Images: but the Reformed suspected that this was done by the appointment of the Princesse; neither was their suspicion without good ground, for it is to be se<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>n in the Kings letters, <hi>Art. 7,</hi> that she had order to hire this raskal company to doe this villany, which fact was imputed to the <note place="margin">Emanuel de Miter sayth, that in Flan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders they took 50 of them at one time, and hanged 22 and whipped the rest.</note> Protestants, to the end that they might not onely be odious there, but also seem guilty, even in the judgment of other Nations; how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit the offenders were punished with imprisonment, yea, with death, even by the Reformed themselues, who jointly confessed the acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on unlawful, and were so farre from giving occasion of offence in this nature, that Papist Burgers themselues offered good security that no such thing should be attempted by them. Who then can make any doubt that they were free from having any hand in those outra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges laid to them, the very opposites in Religion being Iudges, who as appeares were willing to undertake for them; now as their faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulnesse brought so good effect for their persons, so did the Lord worke that the truth of Religion found many friends likewise, the Lord wondrously prospering the course of Reformation, in so
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:177745:52"/> much them that in short space they had in <hi>Flanders</hi> 60 Assemblies, some Churches they themselues builded, but were by Duke <hi>d'Alva</hi> soon cast down, who erected gallowses of them, and hanged them upon them.</p>
                  <p>The Princesse of <hi>Parma</hi> also began to entertain souldiers with pretence to apprehend the Church-robbers, but intended indeed to take away the ancient Liberties and Priviledges of the <hi>Netherlan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders,</hi> wherfore sending certain companies to <hi>Valencyn,</hi> the inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants denyed them entertainment, who for that were proclaimed Rebels the 14 of December, soon after they were besieged, sacked, and many of them put to death.</p>
                  <p>But before they of <hi>Valencyn</hi> denyed entertainment to the souldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, the Nobility had received letters out of <hi>Spain,</hi> from the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quesse <note place="margin">He preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded it for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, but his aime was to get their lands and goods.</note> of <hi>Bargen,</hi> shewing, that the King was exceedingly incensed against the <hi>Netherlanders,</hi> that he had in the presence of many vow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to be fully revenged of them, though it were with the hazard of all his Countries; that he would make them an example to all the world, and would invite the Pope and Emperour to assist him in this quarrel. Vpon the receit of the letters the Nobility assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled at <hi>Dortmond</hi> to consult what were best to be done, but conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded not any thing, some judging it safest to joyn, and make head to resist his tyrannical furie, other seeking rather to escape by flight.</p>
                  <p>Now was the Inquisition again brought in contrary to the Lawes and Liberties of the Country, which the King was sworn to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, for execution wherof there were appointed 12 Inquisitors, commanding them to receiue the Councel of <hi>Trent,</hi> these were cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, <hi>The bloudy Councel,</hi> and so they were indeed, which <hi>Rome</hi> well knew, refusing it, <hi>anno</hi> 1559, when as they fel upon the Inquisitors house, set it on fire, wounded the chiefe of them, brake open the prison, and set at liberty the captiues, and would haue burned a Cloyster that belonged unto them, had they not been by fair means disswaded by two Lords in the Citie, <hi>viz, Marc. Antonio Colunus,</hi> and <hi>Iulio Caesar.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Likewise <hi>Venice, Naples</hi> and <hi>Millain,</hi> though they be Papists, would not suffer it; the Marchants of <hi>Lisbon</hi> who are as superstiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous in the Romish Religion as any in the world, yet they did offer
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:177745:52"/> the King two millions and a half, that they might not haue it in their parts.</p>
                  <p>Yet the cruelty of this Inquisition did here increase, and many souldiers came into the countrey, that some of the countrey for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sook their houses, and resorted towards Freezland, and some did stay at home, and went to meet Duke <hi>Alva,</hi> and welcomed him into the Countrey, and shewed him all the kindnesse they could, but <note place="margin">As the G<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 span">

                  <p>The Prince of Orange, and the Earle of Bredrod, and fiue Earles, eight Lords, and 50 Gentlemen, and they had some fiue thousand of Souldiers being in Freesland, but were most over-throwne by the Duke of <hi>Alva</hi> his forces; so that they were driven to Embden land, and there prepared themselues to the sea.</p>
                  <p>Now the Duke of <hi>Alva</hi> did command all the inhabitants to pay the hundreth peny of all their goods, and of all that was bought and sold; the which some of the States did yeeld unto: And then he commanded them to pay the twentith peny: and then hee com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded the tenth peny of all things that were bought and sold, so often as they should be sold. Some of the States did make their humble petition to the Duke, and to the Princes, shewing them that it would driue all trading out of the land. The Duke of <hi>Alva</hi> told them that he would haue it, though it did ruinate al the land; but if he saw them to doe their best to pay it, he would deale favourably with them.

And now did the Inquisition imprison and execute many of the richer sort, as wel Papists as of the reformed Church: and if they were rich there was no escaping for them. And whosoever was found to haue any hand in way of suit and petition to haue the tenth peny to be remitted, they were adiudged to haue committed high treason against God and the King; and all these must forfeit life and goods to the king, and not any of their children to enjoy one peny worth of the same: but (poore Orphanes) they must begge their
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:177745:53"/> bread. And some that had been buried certaine months, they caused them to be digged up, and hanged on the gallowes, and some to be burned, because they had not the sacrament, and confessed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore their death; but it was because he would confiscate their goods to the king: yea when these insatiable gold-thirsty and blood-thirsty wretches wanted colour to cover their injustice and cruelty, they had their officious imps (false witnesses) suborned by <hi>Iesabel,</hi> to get <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boths</hi> vineyard; witnesse <hi>Martin Hutton,</hi> who was one of the Inquisitors Clarkes, and (being committed to prison) did ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge that hee had made many false testimonies against sundry rich persons, some whereof were of the reformed Church. Here might fitly be brought in the hundred Marchants of <hi>Granado,</hi> who were of the Romane Religion, and were never other; what pretence had he to cause them to bee murthered all in one night, and then presently to command all their goods to be brought to his treasurie or Exchequer, whose estate was worth more then 28 hundred thousand pound sterling? Now as this tyrant was a devou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer and destroyer of the liues of men, so did hee presume to usurpe further not onely upon civil ordinances, but upon the things of God; so that those that were married in the reformed Church, he forced to be married againe: and if they were rich, hee tooke them from their husbands, and gaue them to his souldiers to make prize of them. Those that were baptized in the reformed Church, he compelled to be baptized againe, contrary to Gods word, and to the decree of the ancient councels, so that intolerable were the bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens this cruel <hi>Pharoh</hi> layd, so execssiue was his cruelty, that he fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led all places with blood, <hi>bloud touching bloud,</hi> as the Prophet speaks. For in smal townes hee executed 50, and in great townes 200, and 300 or 400. And in places as men travelled from one towne to another, they might see many that his souldiers had hung up in trees to death, and some were worth 80 thousand guldens, and some lesse: yea this tyrant did confiscate so much lands and goods, as by his account sent into Spain, did amount yearly to 8 tun of mony sterlin<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="9" facs="tcp:177745:53"/> death, and had not brought it to the knowledge of the Inquisition, they did loose both life and goods: yea the 16 of February 1566 he gaue sentence in his court at <hi>Madrill,</hi> that they were all traytors a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst God and himselfe. At Vtrecht he beheaded a widow that was 84 yeares old, because she had before lodged a preacher one night, whose living was worth foure thousand guldens yearly. And at Mastricht a father for lodging his son that he had not seene in a long time, that was fled for religion, was put to death.

And ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny women were put to death, because they received their husbands in the night that were fled for religion; yea they haue killed women great with child, and ripped up their bellies, and taken out the child and killed it: and some they haue fleyed aliue, and covered drummes heads with their skins, and some they haue tyed to a post, and made a small fire round about them, and so rosted them to death.</p>
                  <p>At Naerden they received the Spaniards friendly into the towne, <note place="margin">The like cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elty they did at Oudwater</note> who promised them both their liues and goods; and as soone as they came in, they commanded them to come to the State-house without their Armes, the which they did, and the Spaniards gaue fire upon them and murthered them all: and then they ran about in the town, and ravished the women, and after killed them and fired the towne. The yong children that lay in the cradle, they quartered them, and took them upon their pikes, and so went up and downe the towne, rejoycing in their crueltie.</p>
                  <p>Such savage cruelty is scarcely to be found in any History, what Christian heart can hear it, and not be affected with deep sorrow, yet behold some monsters herein haue been found, that haue been so farre from humanity herein, (for he that hath humanity in him will commiserate others calamities) that they haue applauded it, as if he had in all these outrages done God good service. Amongst the rest, I shall content my selfe at present, but to name the holy Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Pope, and one of his chiefe sonnes in this businesse.

Howbeit that his chiefe son I mentioned (excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding this man of sin, in the sin of cruelty, as if he would verifie himselfe to be ten fold more the child of Satan, then his father the Pope) thinkes not so well of it, his name is <hi>Vergas,</hi> the President of this bloudy Inquisition; for going shortly after into <hi>Spain,</hi> he told the King, that he and Duke <hi>d'Alva,</hi> did marre all in the <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therlands,</hi> by shewing so much mercy to those people.</p>
                  <p>Concerning this Duke <hi>d'Alva,</hi> of whose outrage and cruelty so many haue felt, and perfiduous dealing which many haue found by lamentable experience, wherby may easily appeare of what stamp his excessiue mercies are, even such as the Wiseman speakes of, <hi>Pro. 12. 10, the tender-mercies of the wicked are cruel.</hi> In which he prides himselfe, boasting he had slaughtered eighteen thousand and six <note place="margin">These words he spake at a banquet, as he sate at the Table, rejoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing he had done the King so good service.</note> hundred, in form of justice, in six yeares times, and ten times so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny he and his Souldiers murthered otherwaies.

He sware that he would haue it, and before he would let it fall or remit it, the Sunne and Moone should leaue their shining, so he went to Brussels, and commanded the executioner to prepare ladders and ropes to hang up that night in their doores 70 of the ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizens, and gaue them his warrant in writing what they should be: But God in his providence prevented this his cruel purpose, in that <note place="margin">Anno 1573 April. 1.</note> there came newes that the Graue of Mark had taken in the Brill; so the tyrant did not goe forward with his bloody enterprises. <note place="margin">I haue instan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced but 4 or 5 towns, but there were scarce any town escaped their cruel fillaging, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept they had bribed their Commanders with exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing largegist<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>Thus having given you a taste of some of those many things I haue observed concerning the intolerable oppression, &amp; worse then salvage cruelty of the Spaniards, exercised upon the people, which they endured and laboured under the space of sixteene yeares; I wil now leaue these cruel tyrants to the Lord for judgment, and address my selfe to speak somewhat further concerning this Earle of Mark, who had those Gentlemen with him that fled. Before this hee had layne with his shipping in England, but the King of Spaine sending his Embassadour to our Queen (who was then in peace with him)
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:177745:54"/> to desire her that she would not suffer his subiects to haue their harbour in her land, and that she would not giue them or suffer them to haue any reliefe whereby they should make head against him: and hereupon the Queene sent and commanded them out of her har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour; and she commanded that they should not be suffered to haue any provision in her coasts, so that now they had no other meanes but onely God, who did in his mercie provide for them better then they expected. For they were purposed to haue gone for the Tassel, and to haue taken some towne about that part; but when they came neere that part, they had the wind contrary that they could not come there, so they went for the Ma<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

The Prince of Orange being in France, and hearing what had happened, he sent them souldiers with as much speed as could be out of France. And within one moneth after Duke Alva sent cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine companies to Vlishing to keep that place strong for himselfe, and many of the commanders were come into the towne: So the Magistrates commanded the citizens to come presently upon the Statehouse, so they told them they must lodge the Spaniards in their houses; and they knowing how they had used the citizens in all pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces where they came, they told the magistrates they would not haue the Spaniards in their towne. The Magistrates asked them which of them it was that did refuse to receiue them. They sayd, All of them. So the Magistrates seeing them so earnest against the Spaniards, they joyntly tooke their Armes, and killed and took prisoners all them that were in the town, and with their Ordenance they shot at his ships where the Spaniards were, and they made away. And of those that were takē, there were the names of about 80 that they had in writing frō Duke Alva that dwelt in the Iland, that they should put to death. <note place="margin">Hee had ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed those to be executed because they were the chief that stood a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the tenth peny.</note> So those of the Bril sent their souldiers with speed to help them. And shortly the Prince of Orange came with forces and defended them; and some other townes seeing the crueltie of the Spaniards, forsooke the Spaniard, and joyned with them, and took the Prince of Orange to be their Protector, yet the States notwithstanding did remain in obedience to the King some seven yeares after.</p>

                  <p>Again it is further worthy to be noted, that these Provinces did three times send to the King their Noblemen, but could obtain no mercy, and many more times they went to the Princesse of <hi>Parma,</hi> and made their humble pet<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

The King of <hi>Spain</hi> answered their Embassadours with these words; he bade them tell their Masters, <hi>That they should meddle with their own subjects, and not with his, for he knew wel enough how to rule his subjects without their counsel.</hi> Now when our Queenes Majesty found his unreasonablenesse and cruelty, then and <note place="margin">Ann. 1575.</note> not before, she assisted them with Armes.</p>
                  <p>His own son Prince <hi>Charles</hi> did intreat for them, that it would please him to let them haue their Laws and Priviledges, and that they might not be so oppressed; and withall he told his father that those Countries did belong to him, and that they were given him at <note place="margin">Marplam in his Chroni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle an. 1567</note> his Baptism, for the which his father sent him to prison, and he never came out again. If the Lord would not haue forgot what <hi>Amalek</hi> did, long after, for smiting the weakest and hind-most of his people, how may we in equity forget the infinite murthers, and spoiles, this cruel Tyrant hath executed where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever he hath prevailed? And who can forget in special that bloudie attempt against our selues, in the year 1588.</p>
                  <p>If I should trace this Tyrant from place to place, I should runne in infinitum, having made the name of Christianity hateful, by his cruelty, amongst the Heathens that know not God further then the light of nature: for it is confessed by the <hi>Spaniards</hi> themselues, that some of the cheife of the <hi>Indians,</hi> who were to be burnt to death, <note place="margin">They were exhorted by a Popish Priest to minde, that after this use, there was one place for joy, and an other of torment.</note> being told of heaven and hel, they asked whether the <hi>Spaniards</hi> went when they dyed It was answered to heaven, <hi>Oh then sayd they, we will never come there, for we wil never come where the Spaniards are.</hi> But not to run so far, I wil rest content to keep me within the bounds I chiefly intended concerning these Countries. When the Citizens of <hi>Leyden</hi> were in great extremity, by reason of a long sieg, the <hi>Spaniards</hi> proffering conditions of peace, if so be they would yeeld up the Citie and themselues to them, they returned answer; <hi>Not while they

                     </gap>t to them, of whose perfidi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousnesse they had had so lamentable experience: and when some of the Citizens pressed a yeelding, in respect of the extremity of fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine, a Burgermaster, called <hi>Peter Adrianson</hi> said; <hi>Loving friends, I confesse the famine is great, and that some doe die for want of food: yet rather let us agree to eat up one another, as it shall fall by lot, begin with me first, and devide me amongst you.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>At <hi>Antwerpe,</hi> the <hi>Spaniards</hi> by the appointment of their Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour did come into the Citie in battel order, and marched up and down their streets, and shot into their houses, and made a tumultu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous noise, as if they had been so many devils, for one day and two nights, and took the keyes from the Magistrates, and set watch at <note place="margin">They did this as wel to the Spiritualty, as to the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poralty nosort excepted.</note> the Ports; wherby they put the Citizens in so great fear, that many women with childe fell in travel, and some dyed with feare: and they went by 12 or 20, into the best houses, and commanded them to prepare them the best cheere, as boyled and rost, and other dainty dishes, as they list to call for; and besides beer, they would haue at least two sorts of wine. And all the chiefest Citizens houses had at least ten of these guests. And they all cryed out for mony, and said that they would haue 15 moneths pay, before they went out of the <note place="margin">They did of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer them two parts in mony, and the third in cloth, but they cryed all for mony.</note> Citie, of them; and the Magistrates told them that they would procure them in cloth, and apparel, and mony the summe; but they all cryed out for mony, and that mony they would haue before they went away; so at the last, the Magistrats got the mony, which did amount to 400 thousand Guldens. And the charge they were at, which these companions did cost the Citizens, was 600 pound sterling the day, and thus they were oppressed with them 28 daies, <note place="margin">I doe make but a short re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of some of the cruelties they did a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst this Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, yet there stands in the Chronicle, one quire or paper of their fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther cruelty.</note> in which time they had made them all rich suites, some of sattin and velvet, and some of cloth of gold: and one of them had a cushi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of velvet, with these words in letters of gold. <hi>I am the Dutch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans Bride-well Master.</hi> And thus they got rid of them for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent.
